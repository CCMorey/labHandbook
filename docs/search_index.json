Scientific knowledge accumulates through the consistent, often painstaking, efforts of groups of people. Across the world, webs of laboratories focusing on related topics work toward the common goal of understanding human memory and communicating how best to use our emerging knowledge to improve peoples’ lives. You have opened this manual because you have joined one such group. The purpose of this manual is to help you understand your role in this endeavor and how to contribute in a way that makes your work maximally useful both to your local colleagues, your international colleagues, and the public, both now and branching into the future. Joining a lab is about taking what you have to offer - your intellect, your skills, your diligence - and transforming them into new information. This is not just about you working for the lab: the lab also helps you acquire new skills, start your work from a more advanced point than you would be capable of on your own, and eventually boost the signal for transmitting the knowledge you helped create. Everyone contributing to the lab’s functioning - undergraduate researchers just starting out, early career researchers, university support staff, the principal investigator - plays a vital role in this effort. To maximize the utility of the work we all do, it is crucial for everyone to: Know where to find information about the lab and the procedures we follow Use the common conventions and procedures we have established Propose and implement improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available Communicate clearly and openly about our work Lab procedures have been designed to ensure that the effort you put into your lab work goes as far as possible. Implementing these procedures may require learning something you don’t currently know how to do, or doing a task a bit differently than you have done in another lab. We have examples and support available to help you manage this and learn quickly. No one should need to re-invent anything in this lab that can be copied and modified. You will not be starting your work from scratch, but with at least some building blocks that other researchers have prepared before. 1.1 Hierarchy 1.1.1 Our core team Labs naturally have a hierarchy. While there is no unimportant work in the lab (it’s all important), there is some work that requires a mature knowledge of the literature and a bird’s eye view of our international colleagues’ latest work. The PI (for Principal Investigator) and more senior research assistants are more likely to have this perspective. The most senior staff are also the most permanent, and will know the most about what we have done before, what other labs looking at similar topics are doing right now, and what the most glaring gaps in our knowledge about human memory are. The PI in particular will be the person most likely to be able to see how all the projects in the lab relate to each other and to other contemporary research, to see opportunities for publishing individual pieces of research or combining apparently different strains of research into a single article. The PI’s ability to do this well depends on everyone’s good documentation of their work and open communication about it. Ensuring that the state of your project is always discoverable to the PI increases the chances that it can form part of an important communication, which benefits everyone involved. Post-docs (for post-doctoral researchers) have already earned their PhD, but have not yet started their own lab. Post-docs work here in order to learn more about working memory, get a bit more research experience and more publications, or learn about a method that they did not have the chance to learn about during their post-graduate studies. We are currently trying to secure funding to offer post-doctoral researchers the chance to work on particular projects, but we would also be interested in hosting post-doctoral researchers who want to apply for their own funding to work at Cardiff University on something related to working memory. Interested people should contact Candice Morey (MoreyC@cardiff.ac.uk) to discuss ideas for proposals. Post-docs are the most senior members of the lab after the PI. Depending on their mission, they might be working on their own project related to the lab’s aims, or they might be leading a project that the PI secured funding for. They have experience working in other labs, and can bring their knowledge to our procedures and help us improve them. Postgraduate Researchers (PGRs) are undertaking lab work as part of their preparation of a postgraduate thesis. PGRs are usually PhD students working for 3 years, or maybe 1 + 3 years if their funding also includes a year of MSc study. PGRs’ main priority is completing a coherent body of research for their thesis. All of the research they undertake for that project could end up being published on its own, but pieces could also be integrated into other lab projects. This is one reason cross-project continuity is important. PGRs will usually move on to a research job elsewhere once their education is complete. At that point, research they carried out that hasn’t been published yet may not be their top priority, and the PI and post-docs can be helpful in ensuring that unfinished strands of work continue to flourish. PGRs may also be paid researchers carrying out designated, funded laboratory work. For most intents, temporary paid PGRs play similar roles to PhD students, but paid PGRs will be expected to work on multiple projects, as hours permit. Paid PGRs will have the chance to be involved deeply in projects, and may have the opportunity to take ownership of a line of research. Unlike PhD students, paid PGR time may be re-directed by the PI to deal with urgent work, like collecting data needed for an invited revision. Undergraduate Researchers (UGRs) are a diverse group of students with a variety of reasons for joining the lab. Some will join the lab to carry out their final-year project, and will be active lab members from 1 October until 30 April of a single academic year. Others might be visiting students (on Erasmus fellowships or an internship scheme) working for a set period as long as a calendar year. Others might be working for a short period during the summer (e.g., on a CUROP fellowship). Most UGRs are involved for less than a year, and therefore must be integrated into a larger project. UGRs learn basic research skills working in the lab, and if involved in a self-contained project (like a UG dissertation), they also take responsibility for interim communications about the work they carried out. Because their time in the lab is so limited, it is very important that UG research is well-documented so that the lab can efficiently carry it forward. 1.1.2 How the hierarchy works The PI, for better or worse, shoulders responsibility for the work conducted by her lab group. While everyone involved in the work will be acknowledged when work we have done is published or praised, the PI will always be primarily responsible for correcting problems when they arise, no matter who really caused them. Our work can be questioned years after it has been carried out and published, meaning the PI is the only person committed to this for long enough to realistically keep this committment. For some post-doctoral and PGR projects, the researchers involved might share a long-term commitment to the research and be the “local PI” on the work. In those cases, they will act as the primary person responsible for those projects. Even so, the PI must always have access to enough information about these projects to independently reproduce analyses and replicate findings. While the PI thinks in terms of large, multi-experiment projects, lab researchers at all levels will have the responsibility for individual experiments, projects, or component projects. Elements of any project must always be documented. Every project has designated milestones at which documentation should be completed, backed-up, and shared (at least with the lab group, often publicly). This standard workflow will be described in more depth later. Highlights: Whenever a project is communicated at a conference or published, the documentation, anonymized data, and reproducible analysis scripts supporting the communication must go live unless doing so would violate our ethics agreement (which in our lab, should not ordinarily happen). Whenever a lab member moves on from the lab, every project s/he led must be documented and made accessible to the PI on OSF (for Open Science Framework; osf.io). At the point, if the project is not published, the PI must be given full editing authority along with the former lab member. The work we do in the lab is the PI’s life’s work. You can count on her to see where the projects you did that were not publishable on their own may become useful when combined with the output of other projects. In our list of publications, the contributions of UGR and PGR lab members are emphasized. Data sufficient for a research paper can take years to accumulate; in some of these cases, the student co-authors had completed their piece of the project many years before the paper was published. The ongoing work of our lab can help boost your work even after you have moved on, but that is only possible if the remaining lab members can fully understand and reproduce the work you did. No one can accomplish the work we are striving to do alone. By joining this lab, you are jumping into a big, partially-completed project, whether you realize it or not. Help me make your efforts flourish for this big endeavor and for your career by learning about how this one cog in the grand machinery of cognitive science operates. 1.2 Current lab personnel Dr. Candice Coker Morey, Principal Investigator 1.2.1 Post-doctoral researchers Dr. David Greeno (ESRC Fellow) 1.2.2 PGRs Molly Delooze Teodor Nikolov Aoife O’Mahony (co-supervised with Prof. Chris Chambers) 1.2.3 UGRs Sophie Clegg Poppy Dunbar-Jones Imogen Lee Muhammed Nor Azam Peter Thomas 1.3 School of Psychology staff who support us IT services (it-servicedesk@cardiff.ac.uk) help with computing equipment needs.

We definitely aim for the work we carry out to be good enough to promote to colleagues around the world. We always want our work to be convincing and to make an impact. This section lays out our guiding philosophies for making that happen. 2.1 Choosing a research question Researchers just beginning often struggle with choosing a good research question. That’s no surprise: this is really difficult. There are a lot of factors to consider, both in terms of logistics and potential impact. Under pressure to find a question, the junior researcher might settle for a trivial extension that does not have much theoretical depth (e.g., replicating an interesting finding in a different population). Extensions like that are not necessarily uninteresting, but they usually lack theoretical drive (e.g., is there a good reason to think that the finding would differ in that population?). The strongest research questions also lead to one of a small set of possible conclusions, not just did it or did it not work. Ideally, you want to be clear about what the competing predictions are, and develop a design where you could learn something even from finding a null effect. It is also difficult to estimate how much time a project will take. Even with many years’ experience, I cannot do this reliably. Enthusiastically, young researchers starting their first project often come up with huge, impractical ideas that would be impossible to complete under their time and resource constraints. You should definitely think about what research questions interest you, and you should even think grandly about what you would like to accomplish. But after you have done that, let your PI help. Your PI will have the background knowledge you currently lack to identify ways to refine your ideas and give them more theoretical depth. She will be able to suggest directions you can look into. She will know whether what you are considering is feasible or not. The ability to hone in on a focused and interesting question will develop as you accumulate knowledge. I definitely couldn’t do it as an UG, and I knew at the time I couldn’t. To get a start on my honor’s research, I asked one of my mentors for help. After listening to Prof. Janet Kistner give an informal presentation at a lab meeting, I approached her about doing an UG dissertation (it was optional at FSU, and most US universities actually). My starting pitch was simply that I found her group’s project about the development of motivation interesting, and that I would like to learn more about it, and did she think there was any possibility to carry it further with an UG dissertation project? I wasn’t confident that I could independently identify a good way to contribute, but I could explain why this research appealed to me (it was the clever operationalization and manipulation her group used) and indicate that I wanted to learn more about it. So, you do not need to have a brilliant idea ready - you just need to think about your interests and goals enough to express them to your PI. Then together you will weigh options and refine them. Shifting to the PGR level, you have often identified your topic before you even arrive on campus. Usually, PGRs have agreed about the broad topic of their project with a potential supervisor before even applying to the program. When you are seeking supervision as a PGR, you should be seeking someone who can evaluate the research you want to do. Never spam PIs from whole departments with your request for supervision. Do not bother cognitive psychologists with your proposal about dentistry, or agricultural business administration, or desire to master the Western blot technique (I’ve seriously received earnest, seemingly personal emails from prospective students seeking my supervision about all of these topics). Put in the effort to identify potential supervisors who actively do work in the field you are proposing to work in. You are unlikely to even get a response from the others. Even if you do, it will just be confusing, and is unlikely to lead to good supervision. Assuming you have chosen this lab for good reasons, the first step on arrival at your PGR lab is to discuss your PGR proposal with your supervisor. The proposals we request for admitting students are short and lack much detail. They might contain good ideas, but they are not really plans of action. First thing: sit down with your PI and flesh out a more thorough and detailed plan. There are three main principles that I try to work into any research project: Try to think of a design that can offer you more than one way to address your point. Think about minimizing measurement noise. Show all your final work, preferably publicly. I’ll elaborate on the first two points now. There is so much to say about the third point that there is a whole chapter about it later. 2.2 Planning for converging evidence There are many ways to write an adequate scientific article. Often, scientific articles consist of only one experiment, analyzing one dependent variable. Sometimes a report this simple is striking and clean, and all you wanted to know about that topic. However, usually such a report leaves a lot of unanswered questions. In the best-case versions, the single-experiment paper reports a beautifully designed study, with obvious predictions, clear results, with results coming from multiple dependent measures and all converging on the same answer. I don’t believe that these lovely, succinct papers come from single-shot attempts. I think they come from extensive piloting, and eventually the judicious decision to write a brief paper about the ultimate design rather than write a long paper including every step that led to the ultimate design. While we will never hide the preliminary work that went into a published paper, the ultimate communication we make will reflect the evidence that we are confident about: experiments conducted after piloting, when we are sure we understand how the task is working. Though you should not assume that all the data you collect will be publishable quality, or that you will write a paper about each experiment you conduct, you will save yourself some effort though if you consider in advance what kinds of evidence might help you make a converging case, and how much opportunity to acquire that evidence you can work into your experimental designs. One important tip is to always measure and record the rawest dependent variables possible. For example, we are always measuring accuracy in our work. With accuracy, you can record whether a given response was correct or incorrect. That might be all you are planning to analyze, but it limits you. It might be interesting to know in what way a wrong response was wrong. You might not realize it at the start of your project, you might later think of a way to use errors to determine between two otherwise vague possibilities. By recording only “right” or “wrong,” you are losing information that might have been useful. I’ve regretted decisions about this myself. I have a few data sets measuring spatial serial order reconstruction via mouse click responses. My program recorded a lot, but I did not manage to get it to record response times for every mouse click. There are exquisite analyses that can be done with this information (e.g., Chevalier, James, Wiebe, Nelson, &amp; Espy, 2014) that I unfortunately cannot perform on those data sets (e.g., Morey &amp; Miron, 2016; Morey, Mareva, Lelonkiewicz, &amp; Chevalier, 2018). Our resources are always limited: there is never as much money, or time, or participant energy as we could spend. Make the most of your resources and record as much as you can about your participants’ response. Sometimes it will take extra effort in programming your experiment, but if you get to N=40 and then decide you want those data, you will not only have to figure it out, but you will have to begin collecting data again. Figure it out first, or at least weigh the risk of recording less with the PI before beginning data collection. Sometimes, convergence of evidence will only be possible with multiple experiments. Assuming that we have the resources, we want to write one very convincing paper rather than several papers with evidence that doesn’t support a complete argument. This also lets you better control your narrative; writing about one isolated and interesting result, you will need to discuss the myriad possibilities for interpretation that you have not yet ruled out. Putting multiple lines of evidence in one paper means that you can rule out more interpretations, which strengthens the interpretation your data support. It is unlikely that you will be running an experiment, then publishing it, and repeating that process, so you want to plan for serial data collection, for efficiently processing results, for being ready to collect data during convenient seasons for participants, etc. if you want to write convincing papers that are bursting with clear evidence. 2.3 Minimizing noise Another factor that separates the so-so evidence from the convincing evidence is how clear and obvious the effect looks. Of course we will be doing inferential statistics, but ideally these only confirm what is already obvious in your plots. This means you should collect more data than you think you need to detect an effect of a particular size (more on that later). You should also think carefully about all of the irrelevant factors that could affect your participants’ responses and do what you can to neutralize them in your experiment’s design and protocol. These are things like interruptions (phones beeping in the middle of a task, fire alarms sounding), irritating background noises, fatigue, contingencies that unintentionally reinforce random responding, or individual differences beyond those we normally expect (e.g., participants under the influence of a drug). Much of our lab’s standard procedures have been adopted through experience and practice to minimize extraneous measurement error. Adapting your protocol from an existing one helps you benefit from someone else’s experiences. 2.4 Illustrations of scope and output of student projects It can be difficult to imagine what a reasonable project looks like if you haven’t done one. It is also difficult to generalize enough to say what a great UG dissertation or PG thesis looks like. I’ll try though. Naturally every project is custom, but I’ve attempted to illustrate a holotype - the modal characteristics of a solid, successful project - for UG and PG projects. 2.4.1 Holotype: UG dissertation timeline and workload In the UG dissertation scheme at Cardiff University there are milestones built into the system. You must have a working title and abstract after about 3 weeks. There is little time for thinking about what research question you are asking and how you will answer it, because by the end of October you need to be thinking about how you will implement your design. Start off in week 1 (or earlier if it suits everyone) by meeting with your PI and informally chatting about your interests and what skills you hope to learn during the project. Your PI will have a mental short list of possibilities and can quickly see which ones are most likely to suit you, and how they might be adapted to suit you better. You should leave this meeting with a few ideas and a list of readings. Your project will be one experiment with at least 30 participants. If you are working collaboratively with other students, you might be running a series together or a larger, more complex design that requires a larger sample. But if you are working independently, count on only having time and resources for a single experiment, with ~30-60 participants (depending on session length). Once you have settled on a question, find your deadline, work backwards, estimate how much time you want in between major milestones (e.g., getting feedback from your presentation and submitting, writing after finishing your analyses, analyzing your data after collecting them, etc.). You will probably find that you want to have at least begun data collection before winter break. This is also a bit early in terms of when most UG students collect data, so you will have plenty of participants. This gives you one month to implement your experimental design and develop your protocol. Here is where your PI can help. There will be lots of ready-programmed experiments available from other lab projects. Your PI can help you limit your choice of paradigm to one that the lab already uses in some form, identify modifications you may need to make, and help you see how these modifications fit with what has been done previously. You will learn a little about programming, but unless you already know how, it will be extremely hard to learn to program and create a useful program from scratch in a month. Before collecting data, you will have already: Written an experimental protocol explaining step-by-step how to run a session Tested at least one pilot participant to make sure your protocol includes every step needed Gone over the output from your program with one of the senior researchers to make sure it records everything you need to answer your research questions Scheduled a real participant for a time when one of the senior researchers in the lab can supervise and check that your implementation of the protocol is fine Created an Open Science Framework page for your experiment (with the PI as a full-fledged user), uploaded your experimental software, your protocol, paperwork, and a written description of your method and planned analyses When you return from winter break, you will finish your data collection and begin processing your data. Here is another moment to seek advice from the PI. Our lab manual codifies many useful procedures for processing data, but they require understanding R scripts well enough to copy and modify existing scripts. Your supervisor can help you with this, and direct you to ways to learn how to get specific things you need from the data. You should complete our standard anonymizing steps on your compiled raw data (either on your own or with help from a senior lab member), and then save the resulting data file to your Open Science Framework page. You may now analyze the data and prepare for your March lab meeting presentation, where you will receive feedback on your analyses. After that, you have a few weeks to finish writing. 2.4.2 Holotype: PhD thesis timeline and workload The PhD thesis is a substantial body of work carried out over three years. A good series of PhD studies should produce at least one substantial journal article. Usually, a single “chapter” of the PhD includes the contents of one published or publishable paper. Such a chapter may contain a single experiment or a series of related experiments. A good PhD thesis in cognitive psychology typically contains at least three empirical chapters, plus an introduction chapter and a concluding chapter. A PhD thesis must be cohesive. It cannot include chapters about different things, because the introduction and concluding chapters must make clear how the chapters fit together. So, you must stick closely to whatever topic you and your PI agree on when you begin. It is a good idea to identify tasks that you can complete in parallel so that you are not reactively collecting data, seeing how it went, deciding what to do, and repeating the process. I think it is ideal to jump-start the PhD project by simultaneously working on a related lab project while designing your own first project. This gives you hands-on experience with the lab procedures you will be using so that you can start your own project quickly when it is ready, and potentially involves you in one lab publication besides any that come from your PhD experiments. An ideal timeline could involve starting with related data collection upon arrival, discussing a way to meta-analyze your topic with your PI and working on that alongside data collection, and then using the knowledge acquired from meta-analysis to plan your first experiments. You want to be ready to collect some data in the spring, but to plan for the bulk of your data collection to occur in the academic Year 2 and the fall of Year 3, when participants are widely available. Ideally, January - September of Year 3 is for writing, knowing that you could probably collect another experiment in the spring semester if you think it would help. Each empirical chapter should be a self-contained empirical paper (that perhaps has been submitted for publication). You will have been preparing these gradually during Year 2 and the beginning of Year 3, so some of the months reserved for finishing writing will be spent implementing feedback from peer review. Ideally you will also have some time to consider preparing applications for post-doctoral jobs. 2.5 Making the most of your time Do those timelines sound reasonable? Experience has taught me that there is somehow never enough time. Every hour you can save by relying on existing procedures and pipelines will help you make the most of your effort. You will also naturally find ways to innovate our pipeline as you work, so as others have paid it forward to you by programming experiments you can modify and figuring out useful R functions and scripting processes that you may copy, you will pay it forward by periodically incorporating something you have discovered into our process. 2.6 Workload expectations There is no getting around the fact that scholarship is competitive, and that no matter how organized and smart you are, you will need to work very hard (and almost certainly sometimes for longer hours than preferred or strictly required) to complete your marked work to the highest standard. Especially at the post-graduate level, the quality of your work is your ticket to your next job. The better your work is, the more options you will have in your career after university. I do not mention this to frighten you into over-working, but rather to encourage you to think about how you want to manage this. There must be a balance between work and rest so that when you are working, you are able to make the most of your time. Students are expected to treat their studies like a full-time job (e.g., 35-40 working hours per week, with holidays to be taken at convenient times with respect to the work). I encourage every new starter to speak with me about this: I need to know what your plans and habits are, and I will accommodate them to the extent possible. Because I do not believe that everyone works best on the same schedule, I encourage every individual to think about the ideal hours they would like to maintain, and whether they prefer a strict or flexible schedule. If your ideal hours are very unusual or somehow incompatible with the needs of your project, we need to discuss that as soon as possible. In all projects there will undoubtedly be times when hustling is needed, but fortunately these times are usually predictable (e.g., to get data collection started in time for recruiting free student participants, preparing developmental studies to be run during half-term breaks, submitting an abstract for a conference deadline, etc.). Everyone should be aware that when they have worked long hours, they are entitled to take some extra time to rest and recover. My hours and habits should not be taken as directives by trainees. Though I try to keep weekends for myself and to work 7-8 hours per day, I often work more than that and sometimes work strange hours when I am inspired to or trying to meet a deadline. I feel great relief to get something off my desk, so I may well send an email after typical work hours are over. I’m often traveling to attend conferences or visit other universities, which may be in different time zones (another reason you may get a message from me at an odd time). I shut my work email off when I’m not working and sometimes also when I am concentrating on writing. I do not receive any auto-notifications when my work email is off. I advise everyone to do the same. My assumption is that you will receive messages at some time on every work day when you have explicitly planned to attend to them, not that you will be always on-call. You should not imagine that receiving an email from me means that I expect you to instantly answer it. You are never obliged to answer me at night or on weekends even if you receive something from me after hours.

OSF Review: We’ll check whether any milestones have been reached lately Research content (ordered by priority; we won’t do all things every meeting): Lab members starting a new study will give their elevator speech and demo their program, lab members with new data will describe it for us (must have a graph!), we will discuss a relevant research paper 3.3 Upcoming dates and extra content I also mention here some scheduled meetings with other subsets of members or across the university that I think would interest many of us. 19 - 22 November: Annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society (virtual) 3.4 What’s in it for everyone You may wonder why we do this. One reason is that it is an efficient way for the PI to get information from everyone. The PI will see lab members on other days and times too, but it is useful to know that there is a specific, repeated occasion when we will regularly see each other. Another reason is that it is unhealthy for researchers to struggle alone with difficulties. We prioritize trouble-shooting in lab meetings so that anyone experiencing a problem has a regular opportunity to talk about it with a supportive group of people. It is also useful for others to hear about these problems even if they are not directly affected because 1) it normalizes the fact that everyone struggles with logisitics and programming sometimes, 2) the same problem may impact you eventually, and by attending to others’ concerns in lab meeting, you will at least be familiar with it. We also need a regular moment to mark the interim successes that occur during research projects that don’t merit wide attention. Finishing up pilot-testing, submitting a conference presentation, finding something interesting in an analysis are all moments that call for some celebration, but will only be interesting to like-minded geeks. Finally, you may not yet personally see how another lab member’s work relates to your’s, but it does. Hearing about this work and reading papers together builds our common knowledge space and affords opportunities for generating new ideas. I hope these meetings will always be interesting. Inevitably they will sometimes be boring. But please make the effort to attend and participate. Though you may sometimes not see the immediate gain, you never know when our meetings bring some opportunity for you to improve your project or contribute to someone else’s. 3.5 Project-specific meetings Sub-groups of us shall sometimes meet for specific business that doesn’t involve the whole lab. For instance, many lab members are students, and students may have contact hours with the PI related to their course that non-student lab members won’t attend. The personnel involved in particular projects will convene Data Round-up Meetings, in which we compile, anonymize, exclude ineligible participants from a data set, and securely back-up the data ahead of the analysis. 3.6 Communication between meetings Questions are bound to arise in between these formal opportunities to meet. One way to get resolution between meetings is to consult our lab’s Slack channel. Slack is a group chat system that we use to replace personal email when possible. There is a general channel that all lab personnel should be able to access, and sub-channels specific to individual projects. In Slack, you can see the previous communications, so you can check if the information you need is already documented there. If not, you can submit your query to whichever channel seems most appropriate. If you need a fast reply from a specific lab member, you can @ them and cause a notification to be sent to them that their opinion is required. Whenever you have a question that could be answered by one of several people, or if there are several people that probably need to know the answer, you should pose it on Slack rather than over email. Like with your email, you can tell Slack when to allow notifications to reach you so that you are not disturbed when you are not working. UGRs have a dedicated MS Team for communicating about their project work. If one of the Slack channels is also relevant for their project, they may also be asked to join Slack. "],["seminars-at-cardiff-university.html", "Chapter 4 Seminars at Cardiff University", " Chapter 4 Seminars at Cardiff University One of the perks of working at a university is that you are expected to spend some of your time developing your interests and participating in university life. You are encouraged to attend seminars whenever something that interests you is on offer. You may want to keep the times of these regularly-occurring seminars free during term time. Note - these seminars are all taking place online until further notice. School of Psychology Colloquium: Fridays from 14:10-15:00, usually in 12.11 Tower Developmental / Environmental / Social / Cognitive Seminar: some Wednesdays, 12:10-13:00, 12.11 Tower Open Science Working Group: Join the mailing list (maintained by Chris Chambers, ChambersC1@cardiff.ac.uk) and watch for announcements. Meetings usually include a catered lunch and require an RSVP. Cognitive Development Group: some Thursdays, 14:00-15:00, 3.10. If interested, join the mailing list managed by Charlotte De Moor.

Several UK funding agencies (including Wellcome, ESRC, and Leverhulme) offer PhD studentships. These opportunities tend to be student-led: the student is expected to write the proposal and application. Even so, it is a big advantage to have the advice and assistance of the potential supervisor in crafting an application for a PhD scholarship. Dr. Morey will assist excellent prospective students with applications provided that 1) the research proposed aligns closely with her research interests, 2) the student demonstrates capability to carry out a PhD project (e.g., has a strong prior academic record, strong communication skills, and excellent references from previous mentors), and 3) the prospective student makes contact in enough time to develop and prepare the proposal ahead of the funder’s deadline. (Note: “in time” for something like this is, realistically, at least a full month before anything needs to be submitted.) There are other routes to funding a PhD that prospective students may also explore. Cardiff University offers limited funding for international student fee waivers and stipends. Some opportunities are general, apply to students from anywhere in the world, and there are some scholarships available to prospective students from particular countries. 5.1.2 DEdPsy, Educational Psychology Some of the developmental work we do could serve to support the research training of DEdPsy students. Please get in touch with Dr. Candice Morey if you are interested in hearing about project opportunities and discussing the educational relevance of our basic memory research. 5.1.3 Taught MSc student projects We are happy to host students taking part in the Neuroimaging Methods and Applications, Children’s Psychological Disorders, and Social Science Research MSc degrees. Appropriate project suggestions will be available annually. Feel free to get in touch with Candice Morey to discuss ideas. 5.2 Undergraduate researchers 5.2.1 Final year UG projects Every year we host final year UG projects. A selection of project descriptions are available in the course handbook every spring. Upon joining the lab, students receive an updated list of opportunities for projects. Note though that some projects require the participation of mulitple student researchers. Choice of project is always a function of both logistic contraints and student preference. 5.2.2 Professional placements In some years, we may have the capacity to offer a professional placement to students on a Psychology with Professional Placement course. These positions will be advertised at eligible institutions. Interested students may enquire if they do not see an advertisement in their programme; we may possibly be able to accomodate a placement student even if we have not advertized. Our placement will be entirely research-focused. This may not fulfill the requirements of all placement programmes. 5.2.3 CUROP and SPRINT summer research projects Cardiff University and the School of Psychology offer funded summer internships for current students. Interested students should get in touch with Dr. Morey as early as possible in the spring. Project descriptions will be available in the spring. 5.3 Pre-university students 5.3.1 Nuffield summer intern placements We are willing to offer research experiences to teenagers interested in learning about cognitive and developmental psychology some summers. When we have an opening, we will list it in the relevant places. "],["lab-spaces-we-use.html", "Chapter 6 Lab spaces we use 6.1 64 Park Place, room 0.05 6.2 CUCHDS 6.3 Laboratories in CUBRIC", " Chapter 6 Lab spaces we use We do basic cognitive research with young adults and children as participants. Sometimes we make use of special equipment (e.g., eye trackers, EEG). These needs mean we have a stake in several laboratory spaces within the School of Psychology. 6.1 64 Park Place, room 0.05 This lab is available for use by anyone in the School of Psychology, but in practice it is used mainly by us. The room contains two sound-attenuated chambers with work stations both inside and outside the chambers. Priority for using this space: studies with adult participants in which participants must run singly, and for which noise reduction is very important. (This describes most of our research.) 6.1.1 Access to 64 PP 0.05 Request swipe-card access from the PI, who will forward your request to psychlocks@cardiff.ac.uk. 6.1.2 Security in 64 PP 0.05 64 PP is only accessible to personnel with swipe-card access. The Cardiff University Film Unit is based there, several staff have their offices there, and many PhD student’s desks are in the building. During regular working hours, there should always be people around to help in case of an emergency. Note the signs indicating fire escape routes and current first aiders. As with any building that has restricted access, you should not allow anyone to follow you in when you enter, and you should not admit someone requesting to enter if you do not know who they are and what they are there for. 6.1.3 Booking 64 PP 0.05 Whether you are programming your study, pilot-testing your study, or running participants, you need to schedule any work time in 64 PP 0.05 or risk being kicked out because another person scheduled it properly. We maintain an Outlook calendar for this lab so that you may conveniently book it. You may request access to the calendar from the PI. Once granted access, you will be able to view and edit the calendar “64 Park Place 0.05” from your university MS Outlook account. In general, you may book the lab any time it is apparently free. But do keep in mind that other people may need to use it too, especially during peak participant-running times. We want to always faciliate efficient use of the space. Please consider the following when booking: You should make separate reservations per booth so that we can tell if both or only one booth is in use at a particular time. Don’t “block-book” the booths to run particpants for a long period (i.e., a whole day). You may actually use the room for a long period like a whole day, but make a separate reservation in the calendar for each discrete event (e.g., a 1.5-hour session with a participant). This way, if some of your bookings are not taken or cancelled, you can update the calendar so that the rest of us can see if there are times when the booths might be free. Besides the date and time, your reservation should include your name, and information about what you are doing (e.g., “participant,” “programming,” etc.), and which booth you are reserving. This information helps other users know whether they may be able to step in during the booking, and in the event of a mis-communication about scheduling, helps prioritize. If booths somehow become over-committed, priority will go to running scheduled participants over programming or preparing. During peak times, plan to do any programming or preparing somewhere else, and when you need to use the lab to install your programs and test them, plan to do that during a time that is inconvenient for participant testing. 6.1.4 Peak usage The lab will be busiest during term times. That’s mid October until mid December, mid-January until Easter break, during the regular work day (e.g., 9:30 - 16:30). Whenever possible, do not plan on having access to the lab for programming during peak times. During peak times, the best times to use the lab for preparing a protocol, installing programs, or retrieving data are early in the morning (e.g., before 9:30) and during times when both Year 1s and Year 2s have lectures. For Autumn 2018, that’s Thursdays and Fridays from 10:00-11:00. For Winter 2019, there is no overlap in their timetables. 6.1.5 Storage There are shelves in the lab which you may use to store things that you use while in the lab (e.g., experimental paperwork, notebooks, etc.). Bring some sort of container to keep your things in, and label it with your name. After you complete a study, you should remove the paperwork associated with that study from the lab. Please do not leave personal items in the lab after you are finished working there. When you are no longer collecting data for the lab or working in 0.05 regularly, remove the things you have stored there. The contents of the shelves will be periodically binned to avoid clutter, and anything associated with a former lab member that’s left behind will be binned or appropriated by someone else. 6.2 CUCHDS http://psych.cf.ac.uk/cuchds/ 6.3 Laboratories in CUBRIC 6.3.1 EEG http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cardiff-university-brain-research-imaging-centre/facilities/electroencephalography-labs 6.3.2 EyeLink http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cardiff-university-brain-research-imaging-centre/facilities/cognitive-testing-labs "],["working-transparently-on-osf.html", "Chapter 7 Working transparently on OSF 7.1 The OSF environment 7.2 Using your OSF project page to monitor progress 7.3 Registering milestones 7.4 When copying is okay", " Chapter 7 Working transparently on OSF In Chapter 1, I described how we are working together on something bigger than any single project. My role is both to facilitate your project while you are completing it and to carry it forward when possible after you are finished with it. To do both of those I things, I need to be able to see your work. I need to know what you have finished (and by extension, what you are currently working on) and I need to be able to find your finished products and comprehend them even if I look them up years after you finished them. That means that you need to curate your work in some place that I can always access. By curate, I mean create support that guides me through your work so that I, or any one else, can figure out exactly what you did. It is a chore to curate the materials and data from a project after it is already finished. You forget quite a lot even in the months between starting and finishing a short project. However, while you are working on the project you are actually doing the work I mean when I say curating: you frequently need to explain to me or other colleagues how your experiment works or what you did to the data. So, what I insist on is that you do this in a permanent way by putting this information on OSF (that’s for Open Science Framework), rather than in a private way like jotting it down on your private notebook. 7.1 The OSF environment OSF is a web-based repository that scientists use to organize their research. OSF is free to use. Sign up for an account on OSF by visiting osf.io and clicking the green Sign Up button at the top of the page. Depending on what you are working on, you may need to create a new project or you may be added as a Contributor to an existing project. 7.1.1 Creating a new project Most projects we do will share a common structure: they will include directories for preliminary planning, experimenter paperwork, run files, data and analysis scripts, and communications. If your new project will contain most of these, then you can start by searching OSF for the “OSF Research Project Template” designed by Candice Morey. You can look at the descriptions of the components, and if you like, duplicate this template and use it for your new project. To duplicate it, click the button on the upper right side of the screen that looks like a little branch. A menu will appear below. If you choose “Duplicate this template,” then OSF will create a new project with the same directory structure. You can then fill in the details, delete directories you may not need, or change the names of directories. If you choose “Fork this Project,” OSF will create a new project copying everything about the forked page, including the Wiki content and the project description. All of that can be edited in your new project. Remember that your project, though new to you, may be embedded with some related ongoing project. If so, it might make more sense for you to be added to that existing project as a contributor. Identifying which circumstance you are in will be one of the first things you and the PI sort out. 7.1.2 Becoming a contributor One of the lab members may add you as a contributor to an existing OSF page. This will enable you to at least read, and probably read and edit, the existing page. Our projects usually have the same directory structure, but the number of sub-directories in each section may vary depending on how many studies fall under one project heading. If you are added to an existing project, first familiarize yourself with what is there and how it is organized. Then, discuss with one of the other contributors how you should add to the page. Most likely, there will sub-directories in each folder corresponding to each related project, and you will be asked to create sub-directories for your project. 7.1.3 Naming conventions For the files you see on OSF, there should be some commonalities in how they are named. You will need to come up with a scheme for naming the files associated with your project. This should not be something too generic like “dissertation consent form.doc” or “experiment 1”: if that were allowed we would have dozens of files with the same names. Pick a short name or acronym for your project that says something about what is unique about it. Then, use that short name to name your files. So, instead of “consent form.pdf” your file might be “wmSpanPrefix_consentForm.pdf.” Note also the use of the underscore: it is good practice never to include spaces in file names. Note also the initial word is lowercase and subsequent words are capitalized. This formatting is called camelCase. We frequently have to type file names in contexts where the name must be reproduced exactly for code to run, so it is very helpful if you consistently apply camelCase to all your final names. 7.1.4 Contributors You can see who all the contributors on a project are by clicking the Contributors button on the upper ribbon. You may be able to add new contributors if you would like for someone else to be able to see your page. You can choose whether to let a new contributor only read your page or also edit your project page. At minimum, you and your PI should both be contributors to your project. The PI should always have at least Read + Write access, and possibly Adminstrator access. A bibliographic contributor is someone who will share in authorship on any presentations or papers that result from the project. If you want to share your page with an outside colleague (maybe as part of a job application, or maybe with a peer who is reviewing your work for you) you can add them as a non-bibliographic contributor. If this person only needs to have a look at your project, then alternatively you can provide them with a view-only link without adding them to the project as a contributor. 7.1.5 Public versus private Usually, your project will start out as private, and eventually may become public. Our standard is to set a project to “Public” once we have communicated the data outside the lab by presenting it at a conference or submitting a manuscript. There may occasionally be good reason never to make a project public, for instance if we cannot ensure that our participants’ identities are anonymous. However, normally we can easily do this. 7.1.6 Wikis OSF allows you to describe each project directory and sub-directory with a Wiki. Take a look at the Wikis on the OSF Research Project Template for an example of what you might typically want to know about the contents of a directory. 7.2 Using your OSF project page to monitor progress We will both be able to clearly see how your work is progressing from the updates on your OSF page. The pace of progress will vary but the order of events will be pretty consistent. I’ll briefly describe the usual project components in the usual order. Each of these steps has its own chapter with more detail later. 7.2.1 First you generate a plan When we first start discussing the project, we will converge on an experimental design and will work out the possible outcomes we might observe given that design. This may take a while, through a process of reading and discussion. Eventually, you should aim to note down your plans and predictions in a document, and post this document in your Preliminary Plans sub-directory. Your Preliminary Plans directory may also include work you did that informed your plan. For example, see the Preliminary Plans directory in A complex effect of memory load on processing speed. 7.2.2 Then you prepare your materials You will need to get, modify, or create software to display stimuli and collect responses, craft a consent form and debriefing statement for your participants, work up an experimental protocol, and test that these materials work to all the contributors’ satisfaction. Once we are happy with the materials (i.e., they have been pilot-tested, the output has been checked, etc.) they go in their appropriate sub-directories. 7.2.3 Then you work on data analysis Once you have stopped acquiring data, you should compile it into one file (or we may do this together in a Data Round-up Meeting), anonymize it (more on that later), and upload it to the Data and Analysis Scripts directory. You can add analyses when you have finished them. 7.2.4 Finally, you communicate your research When your written report or presentation is complete, you upload it to your Papers and Presentations directory. At any time during your project, I will be able to see what is on OSF, and with that know what you are finished with, what you should be currently working on. Knowing this will help me give you useful feedback at the appropriate time and be better prepared to help with whatever you might be grappling with. 7.3 Registering milestones OSF provides free storage for your materials and data. You can think of it as a back-up system that encompasses not just your data, but also your thoughts about your project. That turns out to be really important because we need to keep track of what we believed before seeing the data versus what we believed based on the data. Making a registration creates a frozen, time-stamped version of your project. Registrations cannot be changed, while projects can. Someone could remove data from a project, but not from a registration. It makes sense to register your project at key moments where you might want a permanent record of what you thought before the next phase. Generally, we want to register a project: When we have recorded the definitive study design and predictions After the anonymized data are uploaded When the analyses are finished When the manuscript is submitted (repeat as necessary) When the manuscript is published These registrations back-up your work, but also allow you to prove when your hypotheses preceded the data. 7.4 When copying is okay You may be added to an ongoing project, and assume responsibility for some new component of that project. The project might already include materials you could use. But is it a problem to just use them, rather than create your own from scratch? There are some research materials that it is always okay to copy, or modify slightly for a new purpose. You should always make your consent form from the lab’s template. Doing this ensures that important legalese that should be in the form is always there. You do not need to come up with new, original ways to program the same experiment or script the same analysis; it is always fine to copy an existing sample and modify it slightly to meet your needs. You should acknowledge the original creator when doing this, if the original creator is not already a bibliographic contributor on your project (if s/he is, then s/he will already get acknowledged in your work). You should not absolutely copy text destined for your manuscript if you are producing a dissertation or thesis based on the work. Dissertations and theses differ from group-written manuscripts in that a student is composing them to show what s/he has learned about the work and about writing an empirical report in general. If your project is a dissertation or thesis, you must write your work originally, not quote or refer heavily to the method or result from a related lab project. You may look at any example documents we have to see what the other authors included, but then close the example and write your own. If you are working on a project that follows on from another one and is not being submitted for a university degree, then you probably could copy text from related Method sections and modify it as needed. In a serial report of several experiments, the Method and Results of experiments that follow from previous ones are often streamlined by referring back to the first. This is fine for a manuscript intended for publication; in fact, you want to aim for brevity when possible. "],["research-ethics.html", "Chapter 8 Research ethics 8.1 Basic principles 8.2 Applying these principles in our lab 8.3 Assigning participant identifiers 8.4 Ethics approvals currently in place", " Chapter 8 Research ethics 8.1 Basic principles Scientists have done appalling things for the sake of advancing knowledge, such as intentionally infecting people with diseases, robbing graveyards for corpses to dissect, and leading participants to believe that they had critically injured someone else. To prevent scientists from committing such violations (as well as less dramatically awful ones), international conventions now protect the health, privacy, and autonomy of people participating in scientific research. Researchers should be familiar with the Declaration of Helsinki. Generally, issues for concern may involve administering medical treatments that might end up causing harm, deceiving the participants, working with participants who are vulnerable and cannot consent on their own behalf, and protecting participants’ sensitive data from actors who may use it for nefarious purposes. We do not carry out any research that involves experimental medical treatment or relies on adminstration of drugs. We also do not carry out any research that involves deceiving or fooling the participants. We sometimes work with children (who cannot provide consent) and though the data we collect is not obviously “sensitive” or useful to criminals, we acknowledge that we may not be capable of imagining such a use for it, and are therefore under obligation to protect participants’ identities. The research we carry out does not even approach the inhumane violations that inspired the international conventions on research ethics. Nonetheless there are some principles we must always bear in mind to ensure that our participants are never made to work against their will, never put at risk beyond the risks they experience going about their daily lives, and always receive whatever compensation they were expecting when they agreed to take part in the study. 8.1.1 Informed consent All adult participants in our studies must explicitly consent to take part in the research. To do this in any meaningful way, they must always be given enough information about the study to understand what participating will be like and an honest assessment of the risks and rewards expected from participating. All participants must be offered this information and must indicate with a signature that they accept the main points before they are exposed to our studies. A template consent form is available in the shared lab OneDrive folder, in directory templateForms. The main things that must always be included in the information form: A description of what the participant must do: This is from the participant’s perspective. It does not need to say anything about what we are manipulating or why. It needs to describe what the session will be like for the participant. Usually, a session will involve seeing some things on a computer screen, trying to remember them, and indicating somehow via computer whether they remember those things or not. The description should be procedural and should not bias the participant in favor of a particular outcome. A statement about any risks and rewards involved: Usually, our studies do not put the participant at any risk beyond what they experience in daily life. They might feel bored or tired during the session. They are agreeing to participate voluntarily, and depending on the circumstances, may receive experimental credits toward a course or a small amount of money for completing the session. A statement about what we do with their data: We are committed to transparently sharing all of the data that support our claims with the public. But that does not mean that an individual participant’s identity should be publicly exposed. We must tell participants that we will eventually make the data set they are contributing towards available, but before we do, details that could identify them personally will be removed. The most obvious personal details (e.g., name, student id, address, etc.) we do not usually collect at all, and if we do, we never store them with the experimental data. Finally, participants must be given information about who to contact if they are uncomfortable with any part of the research project. This will be the PI responsible (Candice Morey) and the administrator of the School Research Ethics Committee (psychethics@cardiff.ac.uk). 8.1.2 Anonymity Be sure to read the section in this manual about Data Security for a full description of university and lab policy on protecting participants’ privacy. The short version is that we do not save “personal” or “identifiable” data, usually at all, and never with the experimental data. It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not save details that could render our data identifiable unless it is absolutely essential, and when we do, that we use a procedure that makes it easy to sever any link between the experimental ids and real-life ids. We apply this procedure as soon as possible, and once it is applied, we can no longer tell which data came from which person. Signed consent forms must be saved for 7 years. The consent forms we save should therefore never include the arbitrary id assigned to the participant’s data. 8.1.3 Educational debriefing Whether the participants are part of the university community or from the local community at large, part of the university’s mission is to educate. At the end of their session, all participants must be offered information about the research presented in jargon-free language. Participants should also be given information about where they may learn more, and should be given the opportunity to question the researcher working with them or the PI if desired. 8.2 Applying these principles in our lab Individual researchers will not typically need to acquire ethics approval independently. Most research projects will fall under one of our existing, approved generic headings. Individual researchers will need to ensure that their experimental paperwork, data recording procedures, and protocol are all aligned with these principles: Written consent is always obtained. Consent includes explicit acknowledgement that anonymized data may be shared online. Arbitrary participant ids are never associated with participant’s signed consent form. Any document that links personal ids with arbitrary ids must is treated as confidential. It cannot be accessible (in digital or print form) to anyone unnamed on the ethics application. It must be possible to destroy once the links are no longer needed. Once that destruction occurs, it must be truly impossible to re-forge the links. There cannot be a back-up way to reconstruct these links from any recorded data we preserve. An appropriate education debriefing is prepared for every project. Sample debriefings are available in the shared lab OneDrive folder, in the templateForms directory. 8.3 Assigning participant identifiers Assigning an arbitrary id number to each participant is one of the most important bits of lab procedure to get right to maintain data security. This is important both for ensuring that you know which data come from a single unique participant, and for ensuring that all the data you spend time collecting are preserved and usable. 8.3.1 Ids are always unique! Never re-use a participant number in the same project. Even if you know data will be invalid (e.g., test participant, doesn’t meet inclusion criteria). This can cause confusion later, or can over-write files that you may not want to be overwritten. Always use the same participant number for the same person (e.g., if you are collecting data at multiple time points from the same person). Vignette: An ambitious MSc project involved collecting data from participants in two sessions. Participants ran two sessions each, performing two of the four conditions in each session. Eventually though, all of these data needed to be analyzed together. (After all, that is the advantage of going to the effort to get the same data in each participant - you get to do a within-participant analysis.) The student ran each session with a unique identifier. This certainly prevented any data from being accidentally overwritten, but it meant that when it was time to analyze the data, we needed a way to code which ids were actually the same people. There is no elegant way to do this, because there was no regularity between the ids to exploit (coding requires regularity to exploit).

What if the student lost his notes indicating which participant ids should be paired before running the analysis? What if those notes contained discrepancies he could not sort out (e.g., writing down the same id accidentally for two participants)? Furthermore, the inelegant coding solution needed to manage this is also prone to human error. Mis-typing an id number could mean creation of a bogus pairing, accidentally assigning three sessions to one person, etc. After doing this, we had to check carefully that all resulting ids had the right number of sessions, trials, and conditions. In the end, this worked out fine. But work and hassle would have been avoided if each participant were given a consistent id to start with, or alternatively if an id system was used that resulted in unique session ids that were related in some regular way. This problem would of course have been compounded if the design had been more complicated (e.g., what if there were &gt; 2 sessions?) and as the sample size increased (imagine sorting this for 150 participants instead of ~30). 8.3.2 Ids are always arbitrary, anonymous The system you choose for assigning participant numbers should not preserve any links between the participant’s identity in real-life and their identity as a unique contributor to your data set. Ids should not be derived from any university-linked identifier, address, or birthdate. They should not include the date or time of the session. Typical ways to assign ids are to choose a starting number and increment upward with each new participant. If you are running a multi-experiment project, it is a good idea to segregate the participant ids of subsequent experiments in some way that makes them obviously distinct from previous experiments in the sequence (e.g., experiment 1 starts from 100, experiment 2 from 200, etc.). This way, if you ever combine data to perform a multi-experiment analysis, you still have unique participant ids. 8.4 Ethics approvals currently in place 8.4.1 Limits of memory (EC.17.09.12.4952G) This is a generic approval valid until 31 August 2022. This heading covers behavioural studies with adults (17-40 years old) in which participants are asked to try to remember something, sometimes while also doing something else. This heading currently applies to single-session studies of 90 minutes or less. A new risk assessment will be due prior to the expiration of the project. 8.4.2 Memory storage and processing across the lifespan (EC.18.09.185339GR) This is a generic approval valid until 30 September 2023. This heading covers behavioural studies with adults and children, eye-tracking, and multi-session data collection. Examples of studies under this heading include manipulations of complex span tasks and the Flavell et al Registered Replication Report. A new risk assessment will be due prior to the expiration of the project.

At Cardiff University, each academic school has its own School Research Ethics committee (SREC) that is responsible for ensuring that all research carried out within the School has been subject to an ethical review.The university’s procedure for ethical review allows staff and students to achieve research excellence and produce work with the highest standards of research integrity and professionalism. 9.1 Who needs to apply? Staff and students conducting research on humans must apply for ethical approval. In some cases, ethical approval may have been granted by an external organisation (e.g., NHS) and this approval letter must be submitted to the SREC. 9.2 How to apply for ethical review? A great starting point for information and resources about the ethical review process can be found at InsidePsych. Log in with your Cardiff University credentials and navigate to the Ethics tab which can be found in the Undergraduate, Postgraduate, and Staff pages. 9.3 Mandatory Research Integrity Training All researchers must complete the Cardiff University Research Integrity Training module. PGRs and staff members should automatically find this as an enrollment on their Learning Central page. UGRs can access it here. 9.3.1 Types of applications All applications and supporting documents must be emailed to the Ethics committee at psychethics@cardiff.ac.uk 1. Fast track applications: This procedure is used for proposals that do not raise any ethical issues and recruits participants from the School’s participant panel. To recruit from the panel, you will need to sign up for a researcher account on the School of Psychology’s Experimental Management System and obtain ethical approval before you begin recruiting participants. Fast track applications can also be used to make minor amendments to a project that has been previously approved. These applications must be submitted by midday on a Friday and a decision will be made within 7-10 days. 2. Full applications: These applications require more detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures, research design, and ethical considerations. Full applications must be submitted at least two weeks before the Ethics Committee’s next meeting. The committee usually meets on the first Tuesday of every month. Full applications are used when a research project involves (a) recruiting special groups of participants (e.g., children, people in custody, those lacking capacity to give consent, or people engaged in illegal activities); (b) highly sensitive topics (e.g., domestic violence, terrorism, etc), (c) the use of a drug (e.g., tobacco, caffeine, or alcohol), or (d) the collection or use of human tissue. In essence, if the research poses an ethical consideration, a full application must be submitted for review. 3. Generic applications: Sometimes, researchers may have a range of studies they would like to conduct within a research paradigm. In these cases, a generic application can be completed so long as there is sufficient description of the different studies they wish to undertake. For example, a researcher may want to study the effectiveness of recall in different situations. A generic application can be submitted so long as the different studies within this paradigm are described, for example, testing memory in a noisy environment or after participants have had a cup of coffee. Depending on the ethical considerations in the study, these applications may either be a fast track or full application. Undergraduate students are not permitted to apply for generic approval. 4. Amendments to approved projects: Sometimes, changes may be made to a project that already has ethical approval. If they are changes to the research team or the project end date then send an email to the Ethics Committee with the details of the change and the project’s ethics reference number. All other changes require the submission of a new ethics proforma along with the previous ethics reference number for the project. Remember to provide sufficient detail about the changes as if they are minor amendments they will be dealt with through the fast track route while if they are major changes they will be considered in the same way as a full proposal. 9.4 What forms will I need to complete? 9.4.1 Ethics proforma An ethics proforma must be completed for all applications except those seeking approval for minor amendments. The proforma can be downloaded here. You will also find guidance notes for the proforma on this page. The proforma asks for details about your study - who is conducting it, who are the participants, and what methods will be employed. If you are conducting a project with no foreseeable ethical considerations then your application will be considered under the fast track route and you will need to describe the study in Box A. If you are conducting a project that raises ethical considerations then choose Box B and write a full proposal. 9.4.2 Full proposal The purpose of a full proposal is to provide the Ethics committee with sufficient information about the project to help them evaluate the ethical implications and any detrimental impact that the study may have on prospective participants. Make sure to number the pages in the proposal and label appendices correctly. In addition to submitting the proforma, your proposal must contain the following information: Project overview: Include information about the aims of the study, the rationale, and methodology. You must also mention the estimated start date and duration of the project. Participants: State how many participants you intend on recruiting, how old they will be, and how you will recruit them. Remember to mention any inclusion / exclusion criteria as well. If you intend on using flyers or e-mails to recruit participants you can include these documents in the appendix. If you are recruiting children from schools then include a Gatekeeper letter which will be used to contact head teachers when requesting their participation (samples can be downloaded from the Ethics section of InsidePsych). Materials and procedure: Highlight what materials will be used (e.g., a computer and keyboard), the general procedure during data collection (i.e., obtaining informed consent, conducting the experimental task or questionnaire, and debriefing), and procedures for storage of personal and experimental data. Again, include related documents (e.g., questionnaires, information sheets, etc) as appendices. Ethical considerations: A brief description of the ethical considerations associated with the study along with a proposed plan of action to reduce their impact. 9.4.3 Risk assessment Risk assessments are a mandatory part of the ethical review process. When you fill in the proforma, you will also be required to complete an online risk assessment form (link available within the proforma). This form is designed to provide an overall estimate of the risk involved in the project and who is likely to be affected. You will be asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the likelihood of a hazard causing a problem and the severity of injury resulting from the hazard. For example, equipment like computers may pose a risk of electric shock, however, with control measures like PAT testing the likelihood of electric shocks may be low (rated as 1 - very unlikely) while the severity may be rated as 3 to indicate that an electric shock may lead to some temporary injuries. Once you have completed and submitted the form, you will receive an email to indicate if a full risk assessment is needed. If so, the email will also contain a link for the full risk assessment form, guidance notes, and details for where to send the completed form. You will have to give information about the hazard, measures to mitigate its impact, and ratings for the likelihood and severity of the hazard. Please note you cannot submit your ethics application to the committee without a complete risk assessment. When planning an application, assume that you will be asked to revise your risk assessment based on feedback, which may take a few extra days. Once your risk assessment is approved, you will receive a unique Risk assessment receipt number via email. You must include this receipt number in your Ethics Proforma when you submit (your application will be returned to you if this information is not included). You can now submit your ethics proforma together with the proposal (if required) and any supporting documents for ethical review! Remember, you CANNOT begin any research activities until your application has been approved by the Ethics Committee. "],["data-security.html", "Chapter 10 Data security 10.1 Backing up digital data 10.2 Processing paperwork 10.3 Confidentiality", " Chapter 10 Data security Data security refers to the principles followed to protect our data. There are two sides to this: ensuring that our data are not lost and ensuring that aspects of our data that are personal are kept confidential. All lab personnel should complete the web-based Data Security training module offered by Cardiff University. The data we post publicly online should not afford discovery of participants’ identities. There nonetheless remains some information in the data file that interested parties could use in conjunction with other known information to identify a participant. Suppose you are a private investigator, and your client wants you to spy on her child at university. You know your mark is enrolled on the Psychology degree, and you find out that completing this degree involves participating in laboratory studies. You think these studies might be a source of key information about how well your mark can remember abstract visual images, so you follow him to the laboratory, noting the date and time he participated. Once the data are posted online, you can download them and find the participant whose data were recorded on that date and time, even if no other information in the data uniquely identifies your mark. Knowing what we know about the distortibility of data, we can take those visual recognition task data and dubiously infer all sorts of maliciousness. This is obviously ridiculous, but technically possible. It is referred to as the motivated intruder test, and we cannot consider our data truly anonymous if a motivated intruder could easily uncover and exploit the indirect links between anonymous data and identifiable information we may have access to. To comply with EU privacy regulations, we need to take steps to protect participant identities even when we think our data are harmless. This holds regardless of whether we plan to make the anonymous data set publicly available. Unless you are storing the data only on secured Cardiff University resources, it must be properly anonymized. This means that before we anonymize it, data cannot be held even temporarily on personal disks, on DropBox, or Google Docs, and cannot be emailed to non-university email addresses. 10.1 Backing up digital data 10.1.1 During data collection All lab personnel will be given access to a OneDrive folder “labBackUp_cmorey.” While data collection is ongoing, the researcher responsible for data collection should add newly acquired data to the OneDrive lab back-up every day new data are acquired. There are sub-directories in labBackUp_cmorey for all the physical spaces we use to collect data. Simply copy the your experiment directory on the physical machine to the corresponding sub-directory in labBackUp_cmorey. Note that here it will be necessary to make sure that your experimental directory has a unique name. The short-hand name you use for your project can be used for this. Do not choose names like “project,” “dissertation,” “thesis,” “experiment 1.” These data are confidential because they include timestamps that, if linked to the participant’s EMS schedule or to information the participant discloses publicly about their participation in experiments, their identity could be reconstructed. You should not save these data onto portable drives - they are not secure enough. They should be saved only on the labBackUp_cmorey OneDrive, to the lab computers which sit in a secured location, or to password-protected computers associated with Cardiff University. 10.1.2 When data collection is closed Once we have decided not to collect any more data on a project, it is time to compile and anonymize that data set. This should always occur before any analyses are attempted, and must always be done in a scripted fashion. For lab members not fluent in scripting, this should be done in a face-to-face meeting with the PI or another senior lab member. This is the Data Round-up Meeting. 10.1.3 Cleaning up lab directories After we have compiled the data, created anonymized versions, and backed up the original data to Candice’s H drive, it should not matter whether the original data files stored on labBackUp_cmorey or on local machines are lost. These sources are sufficiently secure for our data, which are at most confidential, never highly confidential. In the event that we collect highly confidential data, such data should be deleted from local machines and OneDrive as soon as we have the compiled data backed up to the more secure H drive. For data that is confidential we need not rush to delete it. We shall allow most data to exist on labBackUp_cmorey until the space is required for newer data, and then delete the oldest files that have been compiled and backed up first. The researcher responsible for the data should delete it from the local machine where it was collected after data round-up for that project is finished. 10.1.4 Summary Individual data files may be found on the local machine on which they were collected, unless there has been a crash or overwriting error. Assuming our lab back up procedure was followed, individual data files should be redundantly available on our shared OneDrive back-up. Once we have compiled and anonymized the data, it will not be necessary to access the individual data files. Lab personnel associated with a project shall all have access to the anonymized data via our shared OSF project page. This anonymized data file may be saved redundantly anywhere. It will not contain sensitive or confidenital information. If you somehow lose the anonymized data file and it is somehow gone from OSF, we can recover it by re-running the anonymization script we created on the original compiled data. The PI controls access to the original data, so requests for recovery from the original data must go through her. If we need the original data to prove something about the time period of data collection, the PI must also arrange access. 10.2 Processing paperwork 10.2.1 Consent forms Hopefully, the only paper associated with your project is the signed consent forms. These are definitely identifiable - they contain the participants’ names and dates they took part. We must keep copies of these because it is necessary that we be able to prove that a particular person consented to take part in our research, if the person ever claimed s/he did not give consent. Once data collection on your project is closed, you must turn these papers over to the PI. First, scan the consent forms into one .pdf document. Enter the PI’s email address as recipient. Make sure this is done before the compilation meeting. During the compilation meeting, we shall check that the number of pages in the .pdf consent scan matches the number of participants in the study. If not, we may need to discover which participant did not consent, and remove that participant’s data using the timestamp information. Candice will save the consents .pdf to her H drive. The paper consents will be destroyed in the next confidential waste pick-up. The consents sub-directory on Candice’s H-drive is organized by year. We are required to keep the signed consent forms for 7 years. Annually, she shall delete the sub-directories more than 7 years old. 10.2.2 Paper data If your study involves data collection on paper forms, you must back these up digitally by scanning them to .pdf as soon as your data collection closes. While collecting data, you should leave the paper forms in an organized space within the lab. Paper data should also exclude personally identifiable information. It will also be considered confidential because some combination of lab personnel could work out the identity of the participant by linking the participant id on the paperwork with corresponding digial data with a timestamp. This is why paper data should remain in the secure lab. Once scanned, the digital file shall be saved to the appropriate OneDrive directory and to Candice Morey’s H drive. Data requiring transcription or coding must be duplicated by two independent coders, with any disgreements resolved by a third person. For projects involving coding or transcription, once we have multiple ratings the raters and PI (or a senior researcher) shall meet to compare the ratings and arbitrate any differences. In this meeting, the two rater’s transcriptions shall be merged, a resulting measure evaluated, and ultimately the resulting agreed measure shall be merged with the other project data. All steps will be documented via script. Once this has been completed, and the data have been uploaded to OSF (for anonymized data) or Candice’s H-drive (for non-anoymous data), the paper forms shall be destroyed via Confidential Waste collection. 10.3 Confidentiality We have procedures built into our back-up process to prevent potentially-identifiable research data from leaving the secure university environment. However, our biggest efforts for solving this problem are taken during data collection and study design. Whenever possible (which is nearly always), we do not record any identifiable information about our participants. Unless you need precise information about their ages at test, we do not record birth dates. We never record proper names or any stable identification number with experimental data. When we need to link a participant’s data across multiple sessions, we will do this with a key of real-life identity and contact information to participant numbers, which is destroyed once we have finished collecting data. When we need to use such a key, it is maintained by one researcher, and stored within the secured university environment. Our ethics approval states that we shall destroy this key when data collection is finished. For projects involving a key, key destruction will be the last item on the agenda of the Data Round-up Meeting. Once we have compiled and written the anonymous data files, we shall run tests to be sure that we have correctly matched up participant ids across sessions. Once satisfied of this, we shall delete all copies of the key. "],["designing-your-study.html", "Chapter 11 Designing your study 11.1 Use computers whenever possible to control stimulus presentation and response collection 11.2 Work from a good example 11.3 Record as much as you can 11.4 There are always exceptions", " Chapter 11 Designing your study Investing time into designing your study pays off in the long run. Testing participants is tedious, hard work. During some periods and for some kinds of participants, it is expensive. You want to be as sure as possible that the experiments you run are capable of addressing the points that you are trying to address. What’s more, you want your experiments to address these points thoroughly and well. We always try to design experiments according to the following principles, unless we have a very good reason to deviate from them. 11.1 Use computers whenever possible to control stimulus presentation and response collection Back in the late 1990s when I was an undergraduate student interested in cognitive psychology, I worked in several labs trying to figure out what kind of research I wanted to specialize in. One thing became crystal-clear with experience, and it is even more true now than it was then: if you are serious about becoming a cognitive psychologist, you must be proficient at getting computers to work for you. Without decent tech skills, your work will always be sub-par. Yes, some classic papers were written in which the researchers presented their stimuli in low-tech ways, and the quality of the results were based on their great ideas and committment to conscientiousness. But even if you have a comparable commitment to conscientiousness and comparably great ideas, there will be someone else who has those things and also has sufficiently good technical skills to automate their research designs. And in 99 cases out of 100, that automation will improve the project. Why is that? 11.1.1 People make more mistakes Suppose you want to show participants a stimulus for 1 second. For our research, it may not be extremely important whether the participant is exposed to the stimulus for 900 ms versus 1200 vs vs 1000 ms, the fluctuations in time you might expect if a human is reading out stimuli or manually displaying them on flashcards. But you don’t really know, do you? Suppose a reviewer asks for some confirmation about timing, or thinks that a particular pattern in the data might make sense for stimuli presented for 1100 ms, but would be surprising if they were presented for &lt; 1000 ms. You will need to be reasonably certain about major elements of your methods, and reasonable certainty won’t be possible with human-manual presentation. Computers have brief hiccups that can cause events to be displaced from their stated timeline slightly. These displacements are usually on the order of 7 ms, and these blips are recorded. People deviate way more. Suppose you are showing a participant stimuli on a series of flashcards, aiming for exposures of 1 second each, and you need to sneeze. There is going to be an irregularity of way more than 7 ms. What’s more, you will have to decide, in real-time, whether to record the presence of that regularity in the trial somewhere, which will again take more than 7 ms. If you decide not to, then we will not know from the data that the irregularity occurred, and that trial may be analyzed as though it were normal. There isn’t a great solution for this. But with a good experimental presentation program, we would always be able to check whether our assumptions about timing were met, and if not, how much deviation there was. We could quickly exclude any trial with massive irregularities if we decided it was important to do so. Another example: people are notoriously terrible at judging randomness. If we want some variable to be presented in random order, a human will have trouble distributing the levels of that variable in a random way. What’s more, different humans will have somewhat different ideas about which patterns look random and which don’t. It’s better to let machines sort this out, based on some rules we restrict them with. 11.1.2 People are biased The first rule of objective research is that your hypothesis should not be allowed to affect the outcome of a test. This becomes impossible to regulate when the human delivering the stimuli and recording the responses has a hypothesis about how participants will perform under various conditions. Effects of experimenter bias on test outcomes have been demonstrated in many settings. An example: Tryon ran a research program in the 1930s and 1940s aiming to test genetic inheritance of intelligence in rats. He tested rats on completing a maze, and segregated the rats into groups based on how well they got through the maze. He let the ones with the fewest errors interbreed and the ones with the most errors interbreed, and tested their offspring on mazes for generations. The rats in the “bright” population got better and better than the rats in the “dull” populations generations after the first selection occurred. This may not be so surprising: nearly everyone believes that intelligence is at least partially genetic. But there was more to Tryon’s measure than just that smart rats breeding with other smart rats produces smart baby rats. Tryon’s studies were not blind. The researchers working with the rats knew which ones were “bright” and which were “dull.” Rosenthal and Kode (1963) replicated the research design, but randomly assigned rats from the same population to “bright” and “dull” groups. There were in fact no systematic differences between their “bright” and “dull” rats, except that the researchers working with them believed that there were. Rosenthal and Kode found the same effects as Tryon: the “bright” rats produced offspring better at completing mazes than the “dull” rats. One can imagine how this played out, and the many sources where bias that might affect the rats behavior itself or even just the recordings could be introduced. The researchers would have cared for the rats, making sure they had food, water, stimulation, and clean bedding. The researchers would have put the rats in the maze, counted their errors and timed their performance. The “bright” rats might have been petted more, had their food and water refilled more often or more quickly. When being put in the maze, there could have been differences in judging what was an error, or systematic differences in how quickly the stop watch was triggered and stopped. If you expect the “bright” rat to go very fast, perhaps you very attentive to its run, and extra vigilant about stopping the timer. This bias isn’t restricted to rats. It can happen any time a person has to make a judgment, however minor, about what a participant did, or make a decision about when to deliver a stimulus, stop a clock, record an error, etc. Can this be counteracted? We could take care to always ensure data collectors do not know the hypothesis. But then who would collect data? Usually, students collect data for their own project, which they have contributed to developing. They can hardly keep themselves from forming expectations about the results. The best and most practical way to restrict experimenter bias is to take as many decisions as possible out of the hands of the human experimenters during data collection. 11.1.3 It’s more work in the end not to automate All of our data will eventually need to be quantitatively analyzed. Even data that may begin as qualitative, like responses to questions about how participants performed a task, would eventually need to be coded as falling into one response category or another for some kind of quantitative analysis. So, if you plan to have participants manually write responses, or if you code their spoken responses in real time by hand, you will still need to transfer all of that data to a .csv file. Errors will certainly be introduced when transcribing, so it would not be enough for one person to transcribe these data: it would need to be done independently by two people, compared, and then discrepancies would need to be transcribed again. Properly programmed and tested, the computer cannot mistake which button the participant pressed, or where the participant clicked the mouse, or what the participant typed. The computer’s “judgments” need to be checked at the start, to be sure we know it is systematically recording what we meant for it to record, but once we are satisfied, we can be confident that it is recording these responses the same way every time. It will not get tired and make random errors. It will not forget which button is which. The responses it records do not usually need the time-consuming checking that human-coded data need. A little time spent upfront will therefore save you hours of painstaking work later. 11.2 Work from a good example Whether you are a skilled programmer or totally new to it, your first step to programming your study should be to find an example program that does part of what you need, and work from that. Even though we are currently switching from closed-source E-Prime to open-source PsychoPy, we already have programs or programs-in-progress that execute spatial and verbal memory span tasks, display spatial locations around a circular perimeter, and administer complex span. Don’t start from nothing: break down what you need for your program to do, and ask other lab members for advice finding examples. Examples can come from inside or outside the lab, but if you are programming something that is incrementally different from something we already have, you should work from the lab version. This is important because we want to make sure that different iterations of our studies differ only in the ways we are aware of. If, when exploring programs from other labs, you discover a better way of implementing something, put that on the agenda for the next lab meeting, and explain what we would gain from adopting the other method. Then 1) we all learn something new, 2) we decide as a group whether the method you discovered is worth implementing across projects, 3) we are all at least aware if one task iteration is going to differ in implementation from other similar implementations. Another reason to work from an in-lab example when implementing your project is that it increases the likelihood that programming conventions some of us may have previously agreed upon persist in new programs. It is always rough figuring out just what someone else’s code does. The platforms we favor have some features that help with this, and by working from an in-lab example, you may be able to continue in the style that the rest of us understand. Most importantly, we don’t have a formal ban on closed-source software. We may sometimes use E-Prime, MatLab, or whatever when it is convenient to do so. Good reasons for this include: carrying on from existing projects that use those platforms (e.g., avoiding “changing horses mid-stream”), or when we are collaborating with colleagues who insist on these (though we will generally try to persuade them to let us provide open-source materials). If you are starting a new project, assume that you will be using open-source software. We do not want to use closed-source software indefinitely, and starting anything new with it perpetuates its use. Consider (especially if you are a student) that your next job may not include access to E-Prime or MatLab, so learning an open-source solution makes it more likely that you can continue working with the platform you become familiar with later, rather than being forced by a new employer to learn something else. We favor open-source programming platforms that make use of some sort of graphical user interface, like PsychoPy and OpenSesame. Even if you are an expert coder, you should plan to implement as much as possible using the GUI framework. This is because our lab will never exclusively feature expert coders who can follow along with your code. Our group will always include students who are brand-new to programming and coding, and we need our general-purpose materials to be comprehensible to new users who may wish to use them as a starting point later. Many (maybe most?) of our programs will include some code components, but when it is possible to build in the interface, that’s what we do. Because we need for newbies to comprehend things, code components should be obsessively commented. 11.3 Record as much as you can Though we are committed to documenting our hypotheses and analysis pipelines before collecting data, it is inevitable that we will sometimes think of a great way to test a hypothesis later. There is nothing inherently wrong with data-driven analysis, so long as we are honest about what we predicted before seeing outcomes, so we should try to facilitate getting as much out of each precious data collection opportunity as possible. Programmers must of course ensure that the dependent variables needed for planned analyses are recorded properly, but they should also consider whether other elements of the response may also be conveniently collected. Examples: Your main interest may be response accuracies, but that should not prevent you from also collecting response speeds (and checking that you know how your program records them) Your main dependent variable might be whether a whole sequential response is 100% correct or not, but that should not prevent you from collecting the components of the response (e.g., that the participant responded 8675309, not just that they got a list “right” or “wrong”). There could be good reasons to aurally record spoken responses, to have response speeds for individual elements in a list response, for elements I’ve not yet imagined. You should record as much as you ethically can, and try to think in advance of the ways in which various response elements would work together to converge on a hypothesis (and include those in your preregistration when possible). If you want an element later and did not record it, the only solution is to collect data again, which costs time and (sometimes) money. 11.4 There are always exceptions There will sometimes be projects for which we don’t follow these principles. Sometimes, we will have a good reason for wanting participants to give natural, vocal responses, which currently cannot be evaluated in real-time by a computer. There are bound to be other exceptions. Expedience is not a good reason though. If you have no idea how to implement something, ask for the support of the group. "],["experimental-protocols.html", "Chapter 12 Experimental protocols 12.1 Writing your protocol 12.2 Testing your protocol 12.3 Clearance to begin", " Chapter 12 Experimental protocols The experimental protocol is like a recipe for running your experiment. Each experimenter responsible for a discrete data-collection initiative must write the script for completing a run. This script should be sufficiently thorough that a trust-worthy, non-lab-member psychologist could run it correctly from the script alone. Imagine that you experience an emergency shortly before your participant is scheduled to arrive. Your protocol should be detailed enough that you could run into the Tower building, find another Year 3 or PG student, give them your protocol, and they could do everything from setting up the lab to saving the data. (Note, we would never actually do that. Of course non-lab members cannot do our lab work - see data security. But nonetheless your protocol should be detailed enough to allow it.) 12.1 Writing your protocol The PI will direct you to an appropriate example protocol to work from. Where possible, you may copy from the existing protocol. There no point using your creativity to find new ways to describe instituting similar set-ups. Familiarity also helps other lab members know when procedures were the same and when they differed. Writing a protocol is an exercise in theory-of-mind. You need to think carefully about what someone else does not know about your procedure, and address each point you can think of explicitly. Our paradigms will typically include the following sections. 12.1.1 Setting up Your protocol should start with whatever must be done before the first participant arrives. As a general rule, set-up should be complete 10 minutes before the participant is expected. Assume this, and work backwards for determining how early setting up the lab for your procedure must begin. Set-up will typically include rebooting the computer(s), applying or checking any settings (e.g., for volume, screen refreshing, color temperature, etc.) specific to your experiment, and arranging the workspace. Include every detail that needs to be applied or checked for your experiment. 12.1.2 Greeting and consent How will your participant find the lab? Will s/he be able to reach it on their own, or do you need to meet them outside? You want the participant to feel welcomed and not stressed about getting there, so plan to do what it takes to ensure they know where to go. Remember that your participant might never have been in a lab before. They might not know what they may touch, where they may sit, etc. Instruct them on everything - where to sit down, where to place their things, etc. If they bring food or drink in, they may not have it during the session, but you may be able to keep it somewhere safe for them while they are working. After the participant is settled, the first thing they must do is consent to take part in the study. Consider how you will present consent to them, and how you will emphasize the main points of the consent document. 12.1.3 Instructions and practice All of our experiments should be designed to guide participants through the task, so that after an initial practice period the experimenter is confident that the participant understands what to do. The best means for doing this will vary dependning on your project. Here are some general principles that we have found to be effective: Do not plan to have your participants read through instructions on their own. Of course they can read, but always keep in mind that many participants want to get in and out of the lab as quickly as possible. They will assume that they can just figure it out, and click through instructions like it’s their iPhone legal agreement update. They will get to a trial, and call you over because they do not know when to respond or what button to press. Either use the on-screen instructions to remind yourself of how you will aurally explain the instructions to the participant, or implement a read-instruction system where the participant cannot advance past a screen on their own. One way to do this is to end the instructions with something like “Now, get the researcher’s attention before continuing,” without telling participants how to get off the screen (and choosing a non-obvious exit key that the experimenter knows as the only way to advance). This way, you have the opportunity to check that the participant understands what they are about to do before they begin. Include practice trials, and design them to be representative of experimental trials, but easier. Over-represent the easiest conditions in your practice block so that it will be really obvious to participants what to do. Consider including an accuracy criterion for advancing to the experimental trials, where the participant has to repeat the practice block until they have proven they know how to do the task. (Note: this is more advisable for some paradigms or components than others, and only possible to implement for conditions where you expect very high accuracy.) Explain in your protocol how to guide participants through the instructions and practice. After you have run some pilot participants, you may want to update this section after seeing what they find difficult. 12.1.4 Monitoring or on-call For most of our studies, participants complete the experimental trials independently after passing the practice block. There may be elements of participants behavior that the researcher must monitor or record. If so, what are these? How do you make recordings? What decisions will the researcher need to make? Detail these instructions carefully so that another could reproduce exactly what you do to monitor the participant. If the researcher is simply “on-call,” waiting for the participant to finish, what is the researcher allowed to do? Is it fine to do some quiet work during this time? Use the protocol to let the researcher know that. For what reasons is the participant likely to need assistance during this time? Is there a new block of trials with different instructions? Are there breaks? How often? Include these details in your protocol so that the researcher knows what to expect. Participants might ask about these details too. 12.1.5 Saving and break-down When the participant is finished, the researcher should thank them, debrief them (and pay them, if they are working for pay). The researcher should escort the participant out of the secure lab area or building (for the participant’s convenience as well as to comply with safety and security rules). What else needs to happen at the end of a run? Is there anything to be recorded? How should the researcher save the new data? After the final participant of the day, how should the lab be shut down? If the participant is getting EMS credits, how does one apply those? 12.1.6 Exceptions and unsual events These typically include what to do if a participant decides to withdraw consent. Participants may withdraw for any reason. They may request to have their data deleted. In case they do, you should detail how one would find the new data, and all the steps needed to show them it has been deleted. If the participant is taking part for money and withdraws consent, it is only necessary to pay them for the amount of time they spent. Deciding how to pro-rate participant pay can be sensitive. A good general rule is to round up to the nearest quarter hour and apply the advertized hourly rate. If the participant is taking part for EMS credit, then how to proceed depends on the reason they give. Do ask why they are withdrawing consent, and delete their data if requested. Depending on the reason for withdrawing, their credit might be pro-rated similarly to applying payment. This should always be discussed with the PI. 12.2 Testing your protocol New protocols must always be tested, and perhaps revised, before beginning your study. If your experiment is part of an existing series, you may be authorized to skip testing because subsequent experiments are likely to be very similar to others in the series. But if your protocol is for a new project, or you are new to the lab, you must take it through the following tests. First, run through it yourself. Try not to bring any unwritten knowledge to interpreting your protocol. See if there is anything you need to add. You should always do a complete run of your experiment too, to check that it really does what you expect it do, stops when you think it will stop, etc. Then get another lab member to go through the protocol, and to actually perform the set-up as the protocol instructs. If the lab member cannot do it correctly based on the protocol instructions, then revise the protocol based on their feedback and try again. The lab member may also have suggestions for the remainder of the protocol for you to implement. Run the lab member through your experiment if you have not already pilot-tested it within the lab. The lab member may have suggestions for tweaking your instructions, or may help find uncaught errors or bugs. Once another lab member believes the protocol is fairly complete and the experiment runs as intended, the protocol and experiment should be shown to the PI. (Note: Depending on how much support the researcher needed to program the experiment, the PI may already have seen the experiment itself by this point.) If the PI finds it complete, then she will authorize you to schedule a naive particpant for a time that she (or another senior lab member) can observe. The observing lab member will be present for the set-up, at least the instructions/practice if not the whole run, and break-down to see how the protocol worked and how closely the researcher followed it. After this exercise, the observing lab member and researcher will discuss how the run went, whether any changes need to be made. If no changes need to be made, then the run may be considered the first participant in the study. This participant number may need to be marked for exclusion if major changes are requested. This decision should be explicit, and recorded in the notes the researcher keeps about participant runs. 12.3 Clearance to begin Once the researcher has completed a supervised run, and the supervising lab member finds the run successful, with no changes to implement, then the researcher is cleared to begin recruiting the necessary number of participants. "],["recruiting-participants.html", "Chapter 13 Recruiting participants 13.1 Adults from the university community 13.2 Children from the local community", " Chapter 13 Recruiting participants 13.1 Adults from the university community 13.1.1 Experiment Management System (EMS) The most convenient way to recruit adults capable of consenting on their own behalf for your research project is to use Cardiff University’s Experiment Management System (EMS). EMS has been purchased by the School of Psychology (it is actually more widely known as SONA systems) to manage and monitor study sign-up procedures in conjunction with the participant panel scheme. Year 1 and Year 2 students on psychology degrees are required to participate in research as part of their education, and researchers in the School are responsible for making opportunities for this participation available. Participants can sign up for studies online, researchers can set up their studies online, and administrators can ensure participants have completed all their requirements. This is all done from any web browser, and is available 24 hours a day. EMS is convenient for researchers for several reasons. Researchers can easily signal when they would like to run sessions by offering a schedule of appointments to the available participants. Participants then claim the session they prefer. Settings within EMS allow researchers to exclude participants based on stated criteria or based on studies they have completed in the past, minimizing time spent working with ineligible participants and making it unnecessary to keep logs of previous participants identities. Researchers may also offer study opportunities for “credit” (meaning that students can earn the course credits they need for taking part) or alternatively for pay. The same study can be offered for either credit or payment. 13.1.2 Access to EMS The first thing to do is to obtain a researcher account from the EMS team. This can be done by emailing psychems@cardiff.ac.uk. Just let them know that you are a researcher, working with Dr Candice Morey, and you need an account to post an experiment and shortly they will send you an email with your credentials. 13.1.3 Administering an experiment on EMS This is quite straightforward: when you create a new study, you will be prompted to fill in fields for all the information needed to advertize a study. Some tips: The title should be short and explanatory of what participants will do. It helps to add the word ‘PAID’ in your study as well as the amount if you are able to pay participants; this attracts participants more. Note that participants can only see the calendar with available studies on the selected day (Fig. 1). So it is not necessary to use punctuation (as you will see some studies do) to ensure your title filters to the top of the list - participants see whichever studies have availability on the day they select, not all studies. This means that if you do not open any timeslots, registered participants won’t be able to see your study at all. The system is designed to minimize back-and-forth between participants and researchers scheduling them. You say when you want to work, and participants either take the appointment or leave it. This works smoothly when there is a large population of participants available. If for some reason you need to personally arrange appointments (e.g., if you are running a multi-session study and need to negotiate session times per participant within certain time frames) you can still use the system to recruit. One method for this is to add one timeslot a day and add a comment to your title saying ‘email to book’ or something of the sort. This way participants will still be able to see your experiment. Once you assign timeslots you can also change them, delete them, etc. Just as researchers expect courtesy from participants regarding cancelling and rescheduling, researchers must extend similar courtesy to participants. If you are offering appointments for credit, researchers and participants may cancel for any reason if they cancel 24 hours or more from the appointment time. If you must cancel a session inside 24 hours, then you must grant the participants credit. If a participant fails to show up for a credit appointment, the researcher has some discretion over what to do about it. The researcher is entitled to issue a penalty for this, and should do that unless the participant has contacted the researcher with a satisfactory reason for missing the appointment or cancelling on short notice. Assigning credits and penalties is done through EMS. Once the appointment timeslot is in the past, a dialogue for that appointment becomes available, allowing the researcher to choose whether 1) credit should be assigned, 2) the appointment was a no-show (excused), or 3) the appointment was a no-show (unexcused). Choose whichever option matches the circumstance. With paid participants, you similarly need to cancel 24 hours ahead of time, otherwise the participant is entitled to payment. EMS will remind participants by email of their appointments. You can set your experiment to alert you (or not) when there are sign-ups and cancellations, or when you have filled appointments coming up. 13.1.4 Alternatives to EMS Sufficient numbers of credit and paid participants are available via EMS during both academic terms. During holidays and exam periods, virtually no credit participants are available and the population of paid participants diminishes. If you need credit participants, you must plan to recruit during term time. Even when paying participants, EMS may not yield sufficient numbers during the summer months. Alternative methods of recruitment during the summer to complement EMS include advertising paid research opportunities on social media and flyering in locations where eligible participants are likely to notice (around campus, in cafes, etc.). Calls for participants may be posted on the Take part in research Yammer channel. 13.1.5 Paying participants Paying participants is essential for collecting data outside of term time, but of course it is only an option if you have a source of funding for it. Payments for participants are administered by the researcher, with funds released to the researcher by School of Psychology Finance when an appropriate budget is available to drawn upon. Do you have access to a participant payment budget and want to proceed? You must request the funds you need from Psychology Finance (psychfinance@cardiff.ac.uk) several days before you need the money. It can take up to 2 weeks to receive the requested funds. Psychology Finance need to know the total amount you need, what account to draw it from, and your bank details. If you are a university employee or postgrad, they will likely have your bank details. If not, they may require a staff member to request and receive the money in your name. Either way, funds make their way to the researcher’s account, and the researcher is then responsible for withdrawing them to pay cash to participants, and for ensuring that receipt of all cash payments is acknowledged with the receiver’s signature. To reconcile a budget, the researcher must provide documentation of how the budget was spent, including names, addresses, and signatures of all the participants receiving money, along with how much they received. Psychology Finance prefer not to release more than £500 at once (even if your source has a larger budget) and also prefers not to process a new request until the previous request has been fully reconciled. If you need more than £500 continuously, we will likely need to jointly explain this to the representative and work out a schedule. 13.2 Children from the local community Sometimes we recruit children to take part in our research. We have recruited children by arranging to test in schools and by inviting families to bring their children to the university for testing. Regardless of how you are recruiting children, you will first need to acquire a basic DBS (disclosure and barring service) check. This is an authorized confirmation that you do not have a criminal record that prohibits working with children or other vulnerable populations. 13.2.1 How to recruit via schools It is necessary to first make contact with the head teacher (or sometimes a designated community liaison) of a school and explain 1) what your study entails for the participants, and 2) what we anticipate learning from it. The head teacher can authorize us to send consent forms for parents home with children, and make a quiet place in the school available for testing. In the first instance, contact head teachers via email to the school’s general account or via hand-written note, sent in the mail. Start this process as far ahead of testing as you can; it can take a while for interested schools to make contact with you. Head teachers are extremely busy - we cannot expect that assisting us with research is their top priority. We must make ourselves available on their timetable and respect the limits (in terms of time in the school, etc.) they are comfortable making available to us. Note that our ethics approval requires explicit, opt-in consent from parents, so the first step is always to send forms home explaining what we are doing and why we think it will be beneficial. We can only test children for whom we receive completed, signed parental consent forms. We have only begun working in schools, so cannot yet describe in detail our means of feeding results back to them. We have offered to put on workshops, targeted either toward staff or students, to teach principles of memory. There is a record of contacts attempted with local schools maintained by CUCHDS. If you are attempting to establish a relationship with a school, you should first consult this record to learn whether contact has been attempted before and whether the school is open to working with researchers in general. 13.2.2 How to recruit via the CUCHDS database Often, it is necessary to test children in a controlled setting. We use the CUCHDS facilities for this. CUCHDS features several child-friendly testing spaces, including some equipped with EEG, fNIRS, and eye-tracking capabilites, bookable by personnel with access. (The PI can request access on your behalf - this is done via Ali Roberts.) CUCHDS maintains a database of families who have indicated that they would like to take part in research projects (see TinyToTots). Access to this database is controlled by Dr. Ross Vanderwert. When contacting participants, it is important to greet them personally. Do not send a bulk email to everyone in the database that meets your inclusion criteria. Send a personal message, offering a chance to participate. If the family has indicated a preferred means of contact other than email, use the preferred means instead. Include details about what the child would be doing, how long it will take, who is eligible, and general information about what we are studying. 13.2.3 Recruiting via social media Another way to recruit families is via social media. TinyToTots maintains a Facebook page, and can post a call for participants for a particular study opportunity. To make the most of this, you should create an image including the relevant details that can be posted to Facebook. Details should include what the participant will be doing, who is eligible, how long it will take, until when you are recruiting, and contact information. The flier should include a fun, colorful image to attract attention. The Facebook account is managed by Dr. Ross Vanderwert. The Participate in research Yammer channel may also yield some recruits. It is monitored by a lot of university staff, who actively participate themselves and might be open to bringing their family in for research opporuntities. "],["dealing-with-the-unexpected-during-data-collection.html", "Chapter 14 Dealing with the unexpected during data collection 14.1 The slow participant 14.2 The inattentive participant 14.3 Sleepy, sick, or inebriated participants 14.4 The participant with a lot of questions", " Chapter 14 Dealing with the unexpected during data collection We design experimental materials to be easily administered and as fail-safe as possible. However, that doesn’t mean that nothing can go wrong during your data collection. Here is a description of how participant running usually goes, and then anecdotal exceptions that have occurred to us more than once. 14.1 The slow participant Most student participants are not new to taking part in research, and understand the drill. They want to get in and out of a session as quickly as possible. This is so typical that we must account for it in the design of experiments and ensure that participants learn that they will not benefit from random responding. However, some participants take much longer than is typical to respond. Sometimes, we never learn why, we simply see that their session takes a long time and their response speeds are much slower than average. Sometimes, these participants wish to discuss how they are doing the task in detail with the experimenter. If a participant wants to discuss the experiment with you, always engage with them as far as possible (up to explaining the hypothesis, which you can do after they finish). 14.2 The inattentive participant Remember how most student participants have learned that it is in their best interest to finish as quickly as possible? Some will try to speed everything along: they will grab the mouse and start trying to enter information without knowing what they are doing, will start mashing SPACE, ENTER and random keys to get the study going. Data from this behavior would not signify anything. This is the reason our policy is always to personally explain instructions and have a supervised practice session. Practice sessions should be designed so that the experimenter is certain the participant understands the task, and that the participant is not inadvertently rewarded for speeding through examples and instructions. Sometimes we cannot ensure that a participant will not choose to randomly respond after they are left on their own. Our tasks are often hard, and it would not always be reasonable to impose an accuracy criterion (though sometimes it is). Our strategy is to ensure that they know how to do the task, not to set it up in such a way that non-responding would allow them to finish earlier, and to build in some trials that are meant to detect insincere attempts. Usually, this means including some very easy condition. Even if these trials are not meant to be part of the main design, they can be used to check that the participant understood what to do and was not responding randomly. 14.3 Sleepy, sick, or inebriated participants Student life is difficult, and sometimes you will greet a participant who isn’t in fit condition to be working on anything. The PI has seen participants who came over directly from the pub, who were so ill that they ought to have been in bed, or who were so tired they could hardly sit up. These participants are trying too hard to meet their requirements. If you encounter a participant in this state, the best option is to offer to reschedule them. They will not learn anything from trying to take part. 14.4 The participant with a lot of questions Occasionally, a participant will want to know a lot of detail about how the study works or what will be done with the data. Intellectual curiousity is always to be encouraged. Engage with questions as best you can, but if you do not feel up to answering all of them, refer the participant to the PI or another senior, responsible researcher. Often these participants want to see their own data. Our general policy is only to release anonymized data sets. Note down this participant’s email address so that we can alert him or her when the anonymized data are available. In some cases, we may be okay with giving the participant their own data set as well. The reason that we generally do not do this is that in our experimental tasks, usually there is little (if anything) to be learned from one person’s performance. There is nothing diagnostic we would be able to say about certain task scores, and there is some worry that a participant might try to read too much into their performance. Giving access to the anonymized data would be sufficient to let them have a go at data analysis and satisfy their curiosity about the results. "],["organizing-your-research-data.html", "Chapter 15 Organizing your research data 15.1 Is data collection closed? 15.2 The Data Round-up Meeting", " Chapter 15 Organizing your research data It is very important to start the data curation process as you prepare to close data collection for your project. This helps to ensure that no data are lost, that any paperwork and digital data are consistent with each other, and crucially, that the PI knows what materials are available and how they have been archived. 15.1 Is data collection closed? Because many of the analyses we carry out are based on Bayesian statistics, we do not always need to recruit to a particular, pre-registered N. So in some cases we may stop-and-restart data collection for a particular project. At each of these potential stopping moments though, it is important to log what data we have, what decisions we have made about it, and archive consent forms. When data collection is rolling and managed by one constant person, we might take a less formal approach. But usually, the close of data collection, even if it might be restarted again, should be accompanied by a Data Round-up Meeting. 15.2 The Data Round-up Meeting It’s often the case that the person collecting the data is not the only person analyzing it. But the person responsible for data collection is the only person who knows details about how each participants’ sessions progressed, whether anything strange happened during a session that merits exclusion, and where the physical and digital data are. We do not want to lose this knowledge. The Data Round-up Meeting ensures that we preserve important information the data collector has as soon as possible after data collection is over. Everyone involved in data collection should attend the Data Round-up Meeting, because we will at the same time make decisions about participant exclusions. Everyone who collected data should bring their lab notebook. If a face-to-face meeting including all personnel is impossible, data collectors should at least make their lab notebook available to the PI for this meeting, and have prepared a summary of which participants they think must be left out and why. 15.2.1 Preparing for the Data Round-up Meeting Everyone attending the meeting should prepare in advance, so that it can progress smoothly. If you were responsible for data collection, you must: Gather all paperwork participants completed and bring it to the meeting. If any data was recorded on paper, there should be instructions for putting it into a digital format. This should also be done ahead of the meeting. Scan all consent forms and send the .pdfs to the PI. Make sure all the data you collected or coded is saved to its designated directory on labBackUp_cmorey. If you are analyzing data in software other than R, think about what output you need from the raw data set, and what form it should take. All of these actions must be finished before we can begin. 15.2.2 Pull all the data together First, the team shall compile the data associated with the project from the labBackUp_cmorey folder. It is essential that this folder is up-to-date ahead of the meeting - data collectors, please ensure that you have copied all data to the back-up ahead of time. At the meeting, we will use this code to compile each individual backed-up data file into a single data frame, called d in this example: d = map_df(list.files(path = &quot;&quot;, full.names = TRUE), read_csv, col_names = T) This code creates a dataframe called d that includes all the .csv files in the project directory, which will be entered into the path argument. 15.2.3 Anonymization We shall then examine d’s headings for information that could identify the participant. Anything that has to do with the date and time of the session must be omitted. Recorded birthdates must be omitted. Usually, we would not have recorded anything more personal than that, but if so, it must be omitted at this stage. Obviously, we do need the participants’ ages to describe our sample. We can calculate that. First, it is a good idea to first look at the entries for any year-of-birth or birthdate variable to make sure they are plausible. unique(d$YoB) This code will produce a list of each unique value at YoB in the data frame. Check that they all seem plausible. If they are not, consider whether a weird value might have been a typo by figuring out who interacted with that participant and consulting the relevant notebook. The people in the room must reach an agreement on what to do in the event of a weird value. Options include: considering the age missing for that participant, omitting the participant if they fall outside the recruited age range, judging that a transposition was entered (e.g., entering a YoB of 2020 rather than 2002 was an error because the participant was definitely an adult, or that a 2-digit value like 98 actually meant 1998). In cases where the typo seems obvious, we can decide to fix it, but this must be documented in the script. If we recorded Year of Birth, we can now create a new variable converting birth year to age at the time of the study. For most purposes, this does not need to be very precise. We can do this with a simple mutate. d = d %&gt;% mutate(age = 2018 - YoB) # current year - column name containing the birth year If we recorded the full birthdate, we probably need age in more precision. The R package lubridate is useful for sorting out birthdates and calculating precise ages from birthdates and run dates. Once we have created whatever new, anonymous variables we need from the potentially identifying data, we can create a new data set with the identifiable data omitted. We would do that with script like this, using the select function: # Remove columns that contain ids or timestamps (times could limit the pool to specific people given that the location of the test is known) symsp = symsp %&gt;% select(-c(Clock.Information, Email, SessionDate, SessionTime)) # The &quot;-&quot; negates the select, meaning that everything *except* the named columns remain. Include all the variables you want to omit within the -c() list. The resulting data frame will include everything except those variables. View the resulting data frame to check that this indeed worked as intended. This new data frame is the one we will analyze. Save it now to the PI’s local directory, and also upload it to the OSF page for this project so all of the lab personnel who need to use it can access it. # Save it - this is the version that goes on OSF write_csv(symsp, &quot;symSpan_RuG_anon.csv&quot;) We may occasionally need the identifiable data, particularly the timestamps in it. If we need to prove that the data were collected after a certain date, these timestamps are strong evidence. But the original data need to be kept only in a secure place that is never accessible publicly and that is regularly automatically backed up. Currently the only available spaces that meet this requirement are the Shared and Home drives. Our policy: the compiled, non-anonymized data are stored on Candice Morey’s Home drive. She will store the script we write to anonymize the data and the original data on a sub-directory of My Documents/dataSets_cardiff on her Home Drive. But ideally, after the Data Round-up Meeting, the data do not need to be re-compiled again, and all analysts have the same document to work from via OSF. 15.2.4 Participant exclusions We need to confirm that all of the data we just rounded-up are valid for analysis. Before looking at individuals’ performance, we may already know that some participants must be excluded. Depending on the study, we might have recorded responses to eligibility criteria in the data, or may have this information recorded on paper. At this point, we go through this information and compile a list of participant id numbers to leave out of analyses. We want to compile this list as early as possible in the data analysis script, so that any sub-selecting we do occurs to a data frame that already excludes ineligible participants. We also want to keep documentation of why each participant was omitted. We do this in an R markdown notebook. Here is an example code chunk documenting reasons for exclusion and carrying out the exclusions: # The participants we are excluding based on inability to label one or more pictures: 007, 015, 018, 044 # Checking your lab&#39;s log or notes, describe any participant number who should be excluded based on those notes here. # 37 was videoed but mouth was not visible (and there was no coder in real-time) # 54: program malfunction # 061: experimenter (CCM) accidentally modelled speech rehearsal during practice # 095, 96, 97 were siblings or friends who were run, but not members of the intended age groups. These participants do not need to be counted as &quot;excluded&quot; for the exclusions in Table B, because they were not sampled according to our plan. # Q: Actually 96 is 6 years-old - can we include, or was there another problem? A: There is ambiguity about 96&#39;s age. Value in lab js and log are different. Experimenter is sure that the offline recording of 96&#39;s age is the correct one. # Put all the participant ids who are to be excluded inside this list exSubs = c(&quot;37&quot;, &quot;007&quot;, &quot;015&quot;, &quot;018&quot;, &quot;044&quot;, &quot;54&quot;,&quot;061&quot;, &quot;095&quot;, &quot;96&quot;, &quot;97&quot;) d = d %&gt;% filter(!(participant_id%in%(exSubs))) # Note excluded participants ages for inclusion in Table B # 007 - 5 years # 015 - 6 years # 018 - 6 years # 044 - 6 years # 54 - 5 years # 061 - 6 years # 37 - 6 years # Totals: # 5 years: 2 # 6 years: 5 The object exSubs lists each participant id to be omitted. It is important that this list reflects how the data were recorded. We should check at this point whether the participant ids were recorded as characters (and should therefore be inside \"\"s) or as numbers (no quotes). When they are characters, we should confirm that each participant id is unique and always recorded with the exact same character string (and that that character string is the one we put in exSubs). The filter function performed on data frame data instructs R to keep all rows where the participant id does not match one from the exSubs list. We will also conduct any performance-based checks that may be needed at this point, and add participants who do not meet them to the exSubs list and run the filtering step. 15.2.5 Data wrangling For lab members who are not using R for their analysis, we will discuss the form in which data are needed for your analysis. What variables do you need? Are there dependent variables that need to be calculated? Is any additional filtering (e.g., excluding fast or slow RTs) required? Should it be in long or wide format? To ensure that you exclude the same data that we agreed should be excluded in this meeting, we shall output the data for your analysis from the working R script. 15.2.6 Milestone: Data posted on OSF At the end of this meeting, the anonymized data file that we begin all scripted analyses with should be posted to OSF. This helps to prevent inadvertent data loss, and means we start all analyses with an identical data file. The exclusion script should be made available to everyone as well. Any R analyses starting from the anonymized file should preserve the participant exclusion code agreed in the meeting. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
