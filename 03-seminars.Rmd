# Seminars at Cardiff University

One of the perks of working at a university is that you are expected to spend some of your time developing your interests and participating in university life. You are encouraged to attend seminars whenever something that interests you is on offer. You may want to keep the times of these regularly-occurring seminars free during term time. **Note - these seminars are all taking place online until further notice.**
