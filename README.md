This lab handbook describes the policies and workflow of Dr. Candice Morey's research group at Cardiff University School of Psychology. It is perpetually a work-in-progress. We are constantly aiming to meet this standard and to integrate feasible steps to improve it. It is also aspirational: we might not always achieve this standard, and so we share as much of our work publicly as possible so that readers know what we actually did.
