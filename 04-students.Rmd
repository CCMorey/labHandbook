# Student projects we support at Cardiff University

## Postgraduate researchers

### PhD projects

We currently consider applications for PhD projects.  

Several UK funding agencies (including Wellcome, ESRC, and Leverhulme) offer PhD studentships. These opportunities tend to be student-led: the student is expected to write the proposal and application. Even so, it is a big advantage to have the advice and assistance of the potential supervisor in crafting an application for a PhD scholarship. Dr. Morey will assist excellent prospective students with applications provided that 1) the research proposed aligns closely with her research interests, 2) the student demonstrates capability to carry out a PhD project (e.g., has a strong prior academic record, strong communication skills, and excellent references from previous mentors), and 3) the prospective student makes contact in enough time to develop and prepare the proposal ahead of the funder's deadline. (Note: "in time" for something like this is, realistically, at least a full month before anything needs to be submitted.)

There are other routes to funding a PhD that prospective students may also explore. Cardiff University offers limited funding for international student fee waivers and stipends. Some opportunities are general, apply to students from anywhere in the world, and there are some scholarships available to prospective students from particular countries. 


### DEdPsy, Educational Psychology

Some of the developmental work we do could serve to support the research training of DEdPsy students. Please get in touch with Dr. Candice Morey if you are interested in hearing about project opportunities and discussing the educational relevance of our basic memory research. 

### Taught MSc student projects

We are happy to host students taking part in the **Neuroscience**, **Children's Psychological Disorders**, **MSc Psych**, and **Social Science Research** MSc degrees. Appropriate project suggestions will be available annually. Feel free to get in touch with Candice Morey to discuss ideas.

## Undergraduate researchers

### Final year UG projects

Every year we host final year UG projects. A selection of project descriptions are available to all rising final year students every spring. Upon joining the lab, students receive an updated list of opportunities for projects. Note though that some projects require the participation of multiple student researchers. Choice of project is always a function of both logistic constraints and student preference.


### Professional placements

In some years, we may have the capacity to offer a professional placement to students on a Psychology with Professional Placement course. These positions will be advertised at eligible institutions. Interested students may enquire if they do not see an advertisement in their programme; we may possibly be able to accommodate a placement student even if we have not advertized. 

Our placement will be entirely research-focused. This may not fulfill the requirements of all placement programmes.

### LTA and SPRINT summer research projects

Cardiff University and the School of Psychology offer funded summer internships for current students. Interested students should get in touch with Dr. Morey as early as possible in the spring. Project descriptions for funded opportunities will be available via JobShop in the spring.

## Pre-university students

### Nuffield summer intern placements

We are willing to offer research experiences to teenagers interested in learning about cognitive and developmental psychology some summers. When we have an opening, we will list it in the relevant places.
