Checklist for collecting data on a new study

I. Trouble-shooting:
1. Double and triple check any experiment materials constantly for mistakes, both big and small, e.g.,
   - Are the instructions clear and correct?
   - Is the trial/block randomization/counterbalancing working properly? 
   - Are the number of trials/blocks/conditions correct?
   - Is the timing of the study components (e.g., encoding, RI) correct? Are stimuli appearing how/when they should?
   - Are the relevant measures correct (e.g., the recall recorded is what should be recorded/accurately represents the choice)? 
   - Is the data being saved properly? Are the right columns being saved?
2. Make sure that your experiment materials match what is described what is in your pre-registration
3. Test yourself on any/all of the tasks involved in the experiment with a fake prolific/sona ID by previewing the study on Prolific/Sona
4. Check that your data can be read through your analysis scripts, and ensure that you get the data that you need
5. If appropriate, make sure that your Prolific/Sona redirect links are entered into the script 

II. Prepping to go live:
1. Make sure that any modifications from the previous "Troubleshooting" steps are made to Qualtrics/Mindprobe/etc. 
2. Delete ONLY the data of the previous "Troubleshooting" steps, both recorded and in progress 
   (i.e., don't delete any real data, but there should be none anyway at this stage!)
3. Make sure that your study descriptions, exclusion criteria, etc. are properly set on Prolific/Sona
4. If relevant, make sure that you have the necessary funds in your account (ask Jenny)
5. Get the study ready on Prolific/Sona (links are working, exclusion criteria set, advert is clear, etc.)
 << PROLIFIC INFO >> https://www.jatos.org/Use-Prolific.html 
 - Import experiment onto mindprobe
 - Make sure to uncheck "Allow reload"
 - Go to Study Links to create a "General Single" link under "default"
 - Make sure that this worker type is allowed by clicking the green check mark next to it
 - To test yourself via mindprobe, you can create a new batch called "test" and create a "Personal Multiple" link -- this keeps your fake test data separate!
 - Copy/paste the default batch link into Prolific Study Link/Sona Study URL and pass parameters PROLIFIC_PID or SURVEY_CODE. It will look like this:
		https://jatos.mindprobe.eu/publix/0000?PROLIFIC_PID={{%PROLIFIC_ID%}} 
		https://jatos.mindprobe.eu/publix/0000?SONA_ID=%SURVEY_CODE%
 - If appropriate (see step I.5), enter the redirect Prolific or Sona link under "Study Properties" 
6. Make sure that your pre-registration and any related materials are added to the OSF
7. Make sure that your other folders and files are ready for later deposit on the OSF 

III. Ongoing data collection:
1. Start with only a few subjects at most, making sure that their data can be read in/no issues arising
2. If there is any problem with the previous step, do NOT continue with data collection until it is resolved
3. If testing on Prolific, leave yourself the day to monitor and compensate incoming data/answering queries quickly
4. Read in data early and often to your analysis scripts to make sure everything is working properly before adding new subjects
5. Add maximum workers to JATOS if appropriate/helpful under Worker & Batch Manager / Properties

TIPS:
- To download Qualtrics data: Data & Analysis -> Export Data -> download as csv and use choice text
- To download JATOS data (https://www.jatos.org/Manage-Results.html), depends on what submit function in your script that you used:
	- if you used jatos.submitResultData: Project -> Study Links -> Default batch -> Results -> **Export Results** -> All
	- if you used jatos.uploadResultData: Project -> Study Links -> Default batch -> Results -> **Export Files** -> All
		- Note that then the files are exported as a zip, and annoyingly they seem to have their own individual folders	
		- You might want to instead download the files one by one clicking on the individual file and saving it

- JATOS: The new JATOS links seem to be a different setup since starting E1 of the collaboration project -- it looks like you can still add ID at the end

- JATOS: You can make single worker IDs for participants who somehow messed up and you can verify they didn't start the study
e.g. https://jatos.mindprobe.eu/publix/3657/start?batchId=4151&personalSingleWorkerId=80781&PROLIFIC_PID=60febc18cd038bc135043084
Then go to tinyurl.com and make it a small url with the subject's ID without all of this info in it

<< FOR TWO PART STUDIES >>
- First message:
Thank you for participating in our study! You are invited to the next phase called Working Memory: Part 2, which you should have access to now. Please let us know if you have any trouble.
- Second reminder message: 
Hello! I'm writing to let you know that the places for Part 2 are filling up quickly, so please do take part soon if you are interested. There are only a few spots remaining. Cheers!

Thank you for participating in our study! You are invited to the next phase called Working Memory: Part 2, which you should have access to now. Please note that there are only a few places remaining, so please sign up soon. Cheers! 

Hi there, thanks for your participation! I have just paid you a bonus for participating in Part 1, but as you cannot participate in Part 2, please return the submission. Cheers!

Hi there! I see that you completed part 1, but you had switched screens/exited the full screen during part 2, and so you got booted from the experiment. As advised multiple times, unfortunately this means I have to exclude and replace your data, so I cannot compensate you. So, please return your submission if you would like to avoid me rejecting it. I have credited you for your time in part 1. Cheers!
